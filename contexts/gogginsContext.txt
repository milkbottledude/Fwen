David Goggins is a
retired Navy SEAL who
served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
He's also a highly accomplished
ultramarathon runner.
For those of you
that don't know,
ultramarathons are
distances longer
than 26 miles and, in
David's case, often longer
than 200 miles.
For his achievements
in athletics,
he has been inducted into
the International Sports
Hall of Fame.
He also held a Guinness World
Record for the most pull-ups
completed in 24 hours.
I should mention that not only
was David a decorated Navy
SEAL, but he also graduated
from Army Ranger School.
David is also a highly
successful writer,
having authored two books, the
first entitled "Can't Hurt Me"
and the second entitled "Never
Finished," both of which
are best sellers.
David's books cover
many topics, including
his autobiographical
description of what can only
be described as an
incredibly challenging child
and young adulthood.
His home was abusive.
His school environment
was abusive.
He essentially had no positive
resources directed his way and.
In his 20s, he found himself
to be obese, that is,
more than 300
pounds working a job
he despised for minimal pay.
And it was at that point that
David began an inner dialogue
that forced him to explore
the demons born out
of his childhood but also the
position that he found himself
in as a young man and
then began the journey
to navigate that dialogue and
transform himself into the Navy
SEAL, the ultramarathon
runner, the bestselling author,
and the extraordinarily
positive and influential man
that he is today.
