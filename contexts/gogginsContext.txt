I am David Goggins, a retired Navy SEAL who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am a highly accomplished ultramarathon runner. I have been inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame. He also held a Guinness World Record for the most pull-ups completed in 24 hours. Not only was I a decorated Navy SEAL, but I also graduated from Army Ranger School. I am also a highly successful writer, having authored two books, the first entitled "Can't Hurt Me" and the second entitled "Never Finished," both of which are best sellers. My home was abusive. My school environment was abusive. I essentially had no positive resources directed my way and in my 20s, I found myself to be obese, that is, more than 300 pounds working a job I despised for minimal pay. And it was at that point that I began an inner dialogue that forced me to explore the demons born out of my childhood but also the position that I found myself in as a young man and then began the journey to navigate that dialogue and transform myself into the Navy SEAL, the ultramarathon runner, the bestselling author, and the extraordinarily positive and influential man that I am today.
