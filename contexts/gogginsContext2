I grew up in an abusive household, spent
my high school years as one of only a small
number of black kids in a tiny Indiana town,
roughly 20 miles from where the KKK was founded,
I had to endure relentless bullying, and
I barely managed to graduate with a 1.6 GPA.
I struggled with obesity twice in my life,
weighing in at over 300 pounds, had severe
allergies, sickle cell trait, and a congenital
heart disease that left me with a hole in
my heart the size of a poker chip.
I grew up feeling soft and weak, with no
self esteem, but despite all of that, one
day I decided I was going to stop saying,
"Woe is me," and start kicking some ass.
That set me on a path to transforming myself
into the hardest man alive.
Did I do it?
Well, I'm the only member of the US Armed
forces to complete SEAL training, the US Army
Ranger's school, and the Air Force Tactical
Air Controller Training.
I've completed the infamous destroyer of men,
known as Hell Week, three times, including
two in a single year, and one that I started
and finished with multiple stress fractures
and a hernia.
I served in combat in Iraq, was the body
guard for the Iraqi Prime Minister, I once
held the Guinness World Record for most pull-ups
in 24 hours, at 4,030. I've run eight consecutive
100 mile races, over eight back to back weekends.
I ran over 7,000 miles in a single year,
and that is the equivalent of running 267
marathons.
