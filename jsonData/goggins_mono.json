As we pointed out before, that's a noun. It's a name. It doesn't mean anything. We could call it the Cookie Monster. But what's interesting about this brain area is there are now a lot of data in humans, not some mouse study, showing that when people do something they don't want to do like add three hours of exercise per day or per week or when people who are trying to diet and lose weight resist eating something, when people do anything that they, and this is the important part, that they don't want to do, it's not about adding more work. It's about adding more work that you don't want to do. This brain area gets bigger. Now here's what's especially interesting about this brain area to me. And by the way, I'm only learning this recently because it's new data. But there's a lot of it. The anterior mid-cingulate cortex is smaller in obese people. It gets bigger when they diet. It's larger in athletes. It's especially large or grows larger in people that see themselves as challenged and overcome some challenge. And in people that live a very long time, this area keeps its size. In many ways, scientists are starting to think of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex not just as one of the seats of willpower but perhaps actually the seat of the will to live.",

And all the data point to the fact that we can build this area up. But that as quickly as we build it up, if we don't continue to invest in things that are hard for us, that we don't want to do-- that's the part that feels so Goggin-esque to me, that we don't want to do.

But one thing I like about biology is that willpower, if somebody feels they don't have it, feels like this thing that other people have. But everybody, unless they're brain-damaged, like a hole through their head, has two anterior mid-cingulate cortex, one on each side of their brain. Everyone has one. They have two. So I feel like it's just a question of opening the portal. And the portal-- again, I'm going to say 10 times, and forgive me-- is I think people go, oh, I do hard things. I do sets to failure. And then I do forced reps. I love training with weights. I love doing sets to failure. I even like forced reps. But guess what? I like forced reps. So I'll tell you, they don't build my anterior mid-cingulate cortex because I like to do it. Anything you like to do is not going to enhance this aspect of willpower. And it seems so obvious once you hear it. You kind of go, oh yeah, of course. But I think you really close that loop for people when you share what you're sharing today and what you've shared elsewhere before as well. When you're trying to explain the friction is the critical ingredient. And I think people think, oh, if it's effort, well, then I'm getting better. That's part of it, necessary, but not sufficient, as we say in science. But the suck part, the haunt, being haunted, the stick, they're really unpleasant terms. These are probably the most unpleasant terms we've ever used on this podcast. Those are the-- those are the levers. Those are the gears. And without those, this thing that you're talking about, David Goggins, as a verb-- I sometimes make the joke, but it's not a joke. Goggins is a name, and it's a verb. People go, I'm on to Goggins that. But that's, I think-- again, I'm not a psychologist. But I think that's what you're talking about, the stick, the friction, being haunted.

And there are pain inputs to the dopamine centers of the brain. No one talks about that. Everyone's like, oh, you want the chocolate, chocolate, sex, cocaine. Yeah, that's all true. It'll release dopamine. Pain releases dopamine. The anterior mid-cingulate cortex can trigger the release of dopamine in response to this thing that we're calling friction. And that's a learned thing. That's something that no animal or human being comes into the world learning. We all are averse to pain. And like pleasure, like sugar, fat. Don't like hot surfaces.

They stuck a little wire during neurosurgery into this structure. This was actually discovered by a colleague of mine, Joe Parvizi. Stimulate. And the patients go, I feel like there's a storm coming.

InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help me better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. Now, a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however, is that you get information back about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones and so forth. But you don't know what to do with that information With InsideTracker, they make it very easy, because they have a personalized platform, that allows you to see the levels of all those things, metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera. But it gives you specific directives that you can follow that relate to nutrition, behavioral modification, supplements, et cetera that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman.

You should have seen me working out in high school. I was super fit. People will look back to a time where they felt like they were capable of something. And now they're not. And you kind of want to just grab them and go, wait. That was you then. It's you now. And but people tend to think about how the conditions that were around success must have been part of it. And you can understand why. It's very rational. I was in that situation. I was successful. I'm in this situation. I'm not. That was the past. This is the present. Ergo, capable. You see how people get into these loops. And as you mentioned, you spent the first 20 years of your life in extremely challenged circumstances. And then you can see how people get to a point where everything feels hard. Like, when you're 300 pounds-- I haven't ever been 300 pounds.

Somebody who has created this process for themselves and keeps them in this-- themselves in this forward center of mass with the stick battering the back of their head all the time. Highly unusual. But this internal medicine cabinet that you're talking about building up, true confidence, not needing anything from the outside, I like to think that people want that. They want to be known. They're afraid. But that they want to be known for who they really are and that you're describing the path to do this.

I've certainly felt lost at times in my life, many times. And yeah, there's that thing. I don't think there's a neuroscience or a psychology term for it. Someone will put it in the comments and say, oh yeah, that's what so-and-so said. But like you said, we're not trying to be theoretical here. We're trying to be practical. The business of finding yourself and knowing, oh. But it's sort of like I'm safe because I'm in danger, and I've been in danger before, and I got myself out. It always seems to come back to verbs. Again, I don't have a language for this. For once, I'm lost for words. There's like-- it's about a process, the algorithm. And the reason-- here, I'm just kind of trying to make sure I'm understanding things correctly. One of the reasons why it must be uncomfortable for you to be who you are publicly is because people want to focus on the running or the swearing. And by the way, the swearing is welcome. I'll tell you, I came up through laboratories where all three people I worked for swore a lot. But there was one rule. I couldn't swear at people. So my graduate advisor, brilliant woman, unfortunately, she died early, they all died early-- I'm the common denominator. I had that internalized for a long time. Anyway, she said, but if you swear at people, you're out. But you can swear as much as you want. So that's the rule I have. It's like, you can swear as much as you want. Just don't swear at people. And if you swear at people, better be ready to fight. Definitely not going to fight you. So you can swear at me, get away with it. But the fact of the matter is that it must be frustrating that people-- because I know people go, oh, it's all about supplements and ice baths. Listen, I like supplements. I love supplements and ice baths. But that's not the full picture. It's just a gravitational pull. It's the swearing. It's the running. It's his feet that are all messed up. It's the fact that he got a Triton. He's a SEAL guy. Talk about that too. And there's a gravitational pull for people. And they're missing-- that's the tip of the iceberg, is what I'm realizing.

And when we were just talking a second ago about the deep, true bedrock sense of confidence that comes from looking someone in the eye and telling somebody something that you absolutely know it's true because it happened, you're talking about actions. Not talking about perceptions. You're not talking about what you believe happened. You know it happened. And there's something really concrete about actions. I mean, that's what's so interesting is we're talking about the mind. But actions are the manifestation of the mind. And the stuff that just stays in here, people die with that. It doesn't go anywhere. Long ago, somebody said-- I forget what the context was. It was a neuroscientist. He said, most emotions, they're just emotions. They're just in there. You don't have to do anything with them. And I think certain emotions you want to do something with. But I think people forget this. They feel miserable, like they're going to dissolve into a puddle of their own tears. No one ever died from an emotion. But they feel-- they overwhelm us as if it's a tidal wave. It's going to pull us under and drown us. It's so interesting to me because I think what people-- listen, you have a gravitational pull. People can feel the energy. I think, yes, you're either completely badly or partially understood. There's only one guy on the planet that truly understands you. I think there's one woman, Jennifer, who probably understands you as much as anyone's going to. And then the rest of us are kind of grasping, trying to figure it out. But you're saying, go inward. So first, go inward. And then it's actions. Inward and actions. Now, the inward piece is something I'd like to just spend a little bit of time on because there are a couple of characters from history, people that were in concentration camps. Nelson Mandela. I mean, I'm not sure he had Instagram in there. I'm pretty sure he didn't. And I don't think there was anyone coaching him on, hey, you're going to get out someday. And actually, you're going to lead an entire country. I'm pretty sure that's not how it worked. He had to find it here. He had to find it between his ears. And there are other examples. But that's an important one. So the process of going inward, does it, for you-- and here, I will ask for suggestions because I think people want-- there are those of us who want to build this skill. Wall yourself off. Phone off for big portions of the day, perhaps. Texting off. The requests, the this, the that. Anyone that knows you knows that-- we've communicated a few texts, but most of it comes through a filter. She's great. She knows you. And she knows how to protect your time.",

But when I say dialogue, I think most people think, oh, the inner voice, the chatter. But that's just one half of a dialogue. A dialogue is a two-way street. So I completely agree because I know from experience that when we go inward, oftentimes, we hear things, if we're really honest with ourselves, it's like, oh no, I don't want to think about that. No. And then we start looking outward. Or we start trying to shift our attention or distract. And there are a million reasons that are handed to us, excuses, and seemingly good justifications to be able to do that. But dialogue is a two-way street. And it hit me while you were just saying what you were saying, I was paying very close attention. And I realized David Goggins is talking about the voice that comes up, including the terrible stuff that no one wants to hear about themselves from themselves. But then he's also got the dialogue down where he knows the counter voice. He goes, yeah, you're right. And so I'm going to do this. Or maybe no, remember this. You're in a dialogue, a two-way dialogue in there, not a one-way chatter dialogue. There are books written by famous psychologists about chatter, trying to shift your internal narrative. You're like, bring the internal-- the internal narrative, that's what going inward is about. But it's not one voice. Again, there's a hypothesis. And I'm not claiming to be all-knowing. Lord knows I'm not all-knowing. But you've mastered the dialogue. And if there are three voices, strong, medium, and weak, in there, you're like, let's all come to the table. So you've got a symphony of voices in there that are all you, that you know to be you. And you know how to have those convers-- you're not afraid to be in those conversations.

He's from Trenton. He's a Stanford, Harvard-trained guy. He's also got a lot of street in him. He's had his own hardship, real hardship. He's brilliant. And he said something that I'll never forget, which is, we think that the forebrain, the part of our brain that creates strategy, et cetera, is the supercomputer. He said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. He's like, the supercomputer of the brain is the unconscious mind. It's the part of our mind that's controlling most everything. And most people, unfortunately, don't do the work to understand how their unconscious is controlling them. And that's a scary thing, this idea, like your mind is controlling you. And I'm not going to get into the free will debate. I believe in at least some will. I believe what you're describing and this internal dialogue, I think you have access to your unconscious mind by listening to the dialogue, going inward. We know this is true in sleep, in dreams, in meditation, and just by shutting out everything else, shutting out all the external noise, which is filled with things that pull us to it. Noise makes it sound bad, but it's the gravitational pull of all the things that allow us to distract ourselves without knowing. The ice cream. The have a cookie. The Merry Christmas. The unconscious mind, this huge piece of the iceberg underneath that Paul calls the supercomputer, he's saying that with knowledge as a neurobiologist, psychiatrist, psychologist, so he really knows, that's the piece that if one does real introspection, he calls it the cupboards. You got to look in the cupboards. And it's often really scary what you find in there. And most people are just like, I don't even want to know the cupboards are there. But you're pulling all the cupboard doors open. And then you're-- and you're extremely deliberate with what gets put into action. You're not just going, oh, like, I'm pissed, so I'm going to act pissed. Or I'm tired, so I'm going to act tired. It's you're picking very carefully what to do. And that's a process that I'm guessing came to you. Does it come to you as a, OK, it makes sense why running makes sense. It makes sense why smokejumping makes sense. So it seems like a huge portion of your time is spent understanding yourself and making sense to you. And so when people don't understand you, it's got to be extra frustrating because most people don't understand themselves. So then we're all running around going, you're this, and you're that because most people are just unwilling to look inward. And I'm including myself, by the way. I mean, I've done a fair amount of introspection. But I'm inspired today, that word, inspired, but it's true, motivated to start going inward further because it is scary.

I believe in God too. People can believe what they want. But somehow, your life, God gave you these challenges early on. And then there was a point where you went internal. And like you said, you developed a skill. But it's a perishable skill. And you clearly live in the process of opening those cupboards, reopening those cupboards, trying to spit shine those cupboards, understanding that they're never, ever really done, but that you can gain ground on them, that you can win day after day after day. And you really shared a lot of concrete things that I know people are going to be able to apply if they choose. And I agree with you. I think most people will be like, whoa. That was a lot. It's heavy. I think I want to just kind of bake myself in Netflix and Chex Mix instead. But there's also the reality that there are men and women, boys and girls who hear that and go, OK, and start cracking the cupboards open. And I just know that for myself, I'm extremely grateful that you're willing to put it all out there. You're so brutally honest, so brutally authentic.
