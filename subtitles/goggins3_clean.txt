You had nobody anyway, [ __ ] Look around you. There was no [ __ ] team.  It was you. There was no weight loss program or mom and dad waking you up saying you can do it. You can be better. Trying to build belief. You built belief when you had nothing. Rock bottom to grow that thing. How do you grow it? Do it and do it and do it and do it. That's the hack. the heck it's going to [ __ ] suck. And that's what I realized. That's what I realized. Life,  that's why I wanted to come on here today. I didn't want to come on here and talk about no [ __ ] passion  and purpose and how to get the [ __ ] out of bed and how to hit a [ __ ] alarm clock and all this catchphrase [ __ ] Because that wasn't how I lived. That was how I lived. I lived I woke up like every human being does and goes, 'Fuck, man. I'm a [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] today. How the hell is this going to work out for me?' and you fight that. But this the scary thing why most people don't want to do that and build that willpower is because it is scary. It unlocks a whole bunch of things about who you are and who you're not. And a lot of people don't want to go down that journey to discover who they are and who they're not cuz it's it's not a pretty journey. Like people say, 'Hey, how come you haven't retired yet?' I built all this willpower. Do you think  it's going to let me just retire because my my my knees hurt? It's telling me every morning I wake up like, 'Man, I don't my knees hurt. My legs hurt. My body hurts. But you can still run. So why aren't you running?' Like he said, it's not  like get the coffee, make the make the pancakes, kiss the girl, kiss the kids. You wake up right to work immediately. Your mind is  in action. No one wants to do that. No one. And I don't blame them. But don't be mad when you're laying there in your [ __ ] bed and you're in the [ __ ] hospital and you're 70, 80, 90 years old and you're thinking, man, I feel like I didn't [ __ ] do something. Cuz you did. You didn't do it. You didn't do [ __ ] You may have lived a great life, man, but you're always going to feel empty inside. I don't feel empty, so call me what you want. There's not one empty bone in my [ __ ] body. This isn't a hack. This has to be in you. Something in you has to wake up. And usually the only person that can wake it up is you. And that's the harsh reality of this life that  I want to get across so [ __ ] bad. You can watch me, you can watch you, you can watch [ __ ] Rogan and Cameron Haynes, all these [ __ ] You can go  to Tony Robinson's [ __ ] [ __ ] Do all this [ __ ] and do all this [ __ ] You have to explore, examine  the insides of yourself and what do you really want out of life? Your friend and a lot of people out here just don't [ __ ] want it. So guess what? Have fun with your life. Go from 3 to 350 to 400 to 450 to 500 because you don't want it.  And that's the harsh reality. I can't give you [ __ ] You can't give them [ __ ] Can give you ideas. But end of the day when I was losing the weight, I had to miserably wake up every morning in the cold cuz it was Indiana November when it started. I was miserable. This is your new life. Take it or leave it. There was no one there to pick up the rucks sack, to pick up the boat, to pick up the log, to go in there. It was you. It was you. There was no pat on the [ __ ] back at 300, at at 275, at 250, at 220. No, that was you. So those things that come  out of me that extract from me in the darkness, people are looking for that pat on the back. Where is it? Oh, I don't need it. So whenever [ __ ] gets nasty, David Goggginness goes, 'You had nobody anyway, motherfucker.' So see how I'm telling myself right now? That's me. That [ __ ] fires me the [ __ ] up. That [ __ ] makes me  [ __ ] nuts. You had nobody anyway, [ __ ] Look around you. There was no [ __ ] team. It was you. There was no weight loss program or mom and dad waking you up saying you  can do it. You can be better. Trying to build belief. You built belief when you had nothing. Rock bottom. You did that. So, as times get hard for me, the  truth comes out. And my truth is powerful as [ __ ] It's real. It's tangible. I feel it. It comes  out of my brain as I speak about it. I'm reliving every single dark moment of my life to be here. So that is what people don't get. That is what motivates David Gogggins is the unseen work.
