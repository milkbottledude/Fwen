I don't take any days off.  Seven days a week. There's so many people that have the ability and just refuse to get off that couch. Refuse to study a few more hours. Refuse to go deeper to go further. It's so easy to be great nowadays, my friend. Because most people are weak. Most people don't want to go to that extra mile. Most people don't want to find that extra because it sucks. It's miserable. is lonely. You cannot live in that normal mindset. You must be your best on your worst days. And how you do that is you cannot think of a normal mindset. You cannot have a normal mindset. You know, if you're on social media running your mouth,  you're just a [ __ ]  Correct.  You're honestly that's not me trying to be some after school special.  You really are a [ __ ]  Real men ain't doing it. We really don't care about that gossipy [ __ ] Get to work, man.  In life, it's important to not always draft. Sometimes you got to lead and block the [ __ ] wind.  My brainstorming sessions is [ __ ] out there in the [ __ ] grip of life [ __ ] grinding. And that's where I think all my material comes from to suck. We are all being tested in life. While my test is different than yours, you will be tested. and how you face that test and how you overcome that test determine the rest of your life. The one mentality that you must have in life is that regardless of what's in front of you, you still must grind. I'll never be in the Olympics. I'll never be a professional athlete, but still I grind. I fail at most things I do, but still I grind. I don't want to do half the [ __ ] I do, but still I grind. And that one day you see me down a dark alley run at one o'clock in the morning. Know one thing I was grinding. So I invented Gogggins. I invented a [ __ ] that that that realized we're not good enough. But Gogggins realizes we're mentally strong as [ __ ] and we're going to outstrength these [ __ ] in the mind.  So what's your [ __ ] excuse? Is it too cold where you live? Is it too hot where you live? Does it rain too [ __ ] much? Now it's time for some real [ __ ] talk. Maybe you're the only black person applying for a [ __ ] job. Maybe the only female. Maybe the only [ __ ] gay person job. Whatever the [ __ ] it may be. Maybe that shit's in your [ __ ] head. Maybe that's your excuse for not being better. Life's a real big [ __ ] picture. When I was young, all those things got in my head. black, [ __ ] not smart enough, single mom, all that [ __ ] Own space in my head. If you're allowing people and things and situations to own space in your [ __ ] head, you're losing. Last thing, life's one big [ __ ] head game. You play with yourself. If you lose, it's because you allow life to get in your [ __ ] head. Stay hard. When you really sit back at your life and you are in that dark room and you're looking at where you started from and you tell yourself, 'God, dog, man, my my mom is this way. My student stepdad got murdered. My dad beat the [ __ ] out of me. I can't read and write to save my [ __ ] soul. I've lied about it to everybody. I've cheated on all these tests. My god, man.' And then you put a goal in your mind. How you going to feel, man, when you accomplish this goal coming from that [ __ ] Coming from the [ __ ] hell you came from. A lot of people start from a good starting point. You have a good foundation. What if you can surpass all of these [ __ ] We have everybody who was [ __ ] way up here. Started up here and you had you started with no legs. You had to grow [ __ ] legs to even start walking and then crawling and then running and then you start passing people and all that's given to them. I had to use all this negative [ __ ] that was making me weak and horrible as a person. I had to use this as the power that now fueled me. I had to flip it on its head and say, 'Hold up. This might be exactly what I need. The darkness is exactly what I need.' It's how you look at your situation. And I was looking at it all [ __ ] up. Sometimes you got to fight pain with pain. Stay hard. People don't know how to turn their minds on. People don't know about this boats and laws, why I say it, why I start yelling. I'm trying to activate something. I'm trying to activate passion, want, hunger, the dog, the savage. That [ __ ] is falling asleep. When I show up know I'm in the great shape, I can wake that savage beast up. You got to learn yourself. Know what know how to wake yourself up. But if you don't show up in the best shape of your life, your mind is worthless to you. So your savage is [ __ ] dead. Stay hard.  I want to see that guy who immersed himself in [ __ ] hell. And he thought about quitting and leaving and and his wife and his kids and why am I here? Is this is it worth it? All this crazy [ __ ] and still said and found out a way to get through it. So basically that's that's the bottom line of it all. We all want to read about how we can quickly get somewhere. That's why the six-minute abs and all sort of [ __ ] so powerful that you may get some results from it, but they're not permanent. The permanent result comes from you [ __ ] I say it all the time. You have to suffer. You have to make that a tattoo on your [ __ ] brain so when that hard time comes again, you don't forget it. A lot of you are trying to find inspiration and motivation with a depressed mindset. You're depressed because you're not doing [ __ ] with yourself. You don't find inspiration by not living in the grip of life. You need to live in the grip of life to find inspiration. Put challenges in front of yourself. When you put a challenge in front of yourself and you attack it, that's when you find inspiration. Try to be 10% better than you were last week. So if you're running 30 miles a week, run 33. If you're swimming 500 meters, swim 550. If some of you aren't doing [ __ ] your 10% is just getting off the [ __ ] couch. The more you walk away from accountability, the weaker you become. Find yourself in the grip of life. You can't find yourself by doing nothing. It might be April where you are and you expecting nice weather and [ __ ] but it's 20°. So you might be somewhere where it's too [ __ ] hot. So you might have sore legs, sore back, sore shoulder. So the struggle is real. It never gets any easier. You got to get harder. I was out yesterday getting after it. Had one of the best runs I've had in a long time. PR that [ __ ] So no one cares what you did yesterday. It only matters doing today. Those who take me literally. So, I'm a cheerleader for those who want to be better, not for those who want to stay the same. Stay hard. If you're a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher, a medic, all kind of different professions in life, you have to reertify every [ __ ] year. If not every year, every couple years. Almost every job in the world has to reertify. There's different kind of tools and knowledge that comes out. Everything is constantly evolving. As human beings, we are evolving. So you get those cus. So right now I'm at Moab 240. You got to also certify or reertify as a [ __ ] savage. So I had a hard life growing up. My life is good now. Don't need to do this [ __ ] It's time to reertify as a savage. Stay hard. There's no other way to make it out here. I mean, you can't just always be, you know, head down in the sand. You got to learn to pick yourself up on your own. A lot of times these fights and these battles, you got to be your own [ __ ] coach. You got to be your own motivator. For the first 20ome years of my life, it was just darkness. But if you are able to get up every morning, have no passion, no drive, no motivation, no [ __ ] and still get up with that kind of fire, you will be successful in life. I guarantee you that. I believe in self-discipline, self-ride, selfm motivation. No one has that self anymore. That self is gone. This isn't for the masses. This is for those who want to leave normal behind. Those who are in search of a new realm. It's a lonely journey. You're isolated. Those who used to keep pace with you will fall off. They'll see where their world ends and yours begins. Your ability to suffer, endure. Our work must be greater. You must be willing to extend yourself to the limit with no guarantee of success. Every day you must ask yourself. Did I do enough?  There'll always be complications and setbacks before the finish line. We must be ready for them. Stay hard.  Who's going to carry the boats?  How about days off? One day, but not today. And it makes me so [ __ ] mad. Every day I walk this earth and I see average all over the [ __ ] place and they want to ask me how did you do it? I can't tell you how cuz you're not going to [ __ ] you're not going to do it. You're not going to do it. You're just you're going to continue being because every day you wake up like he said it's not like get the coffee, make the make the pancakes, kiss the girl, kiss the kids. You wake up right to work immediately. Your mind is in action. I know what darkness looks like. I know what it feels like to be alone with no motivation, no drive, no passion. And what has to come out of your [ __ ] soul in the darkest of times is what you just did right there. It's funny, man. People want to know how I'm always motivated. It's the unseen work. Like, I'm out running at 2:00 in the morning, 1:00 in the morning, in the gym, long sessions by myself. you. That's real. How I'm able to just extract dopamine, the good dopamine whenever I want. Man, I've trained 99% of my life alone. No one pat me on the back. I did all of the work alone. I hate that people know me for that guy because that guy is not every [ __ ] day. Like when they see me, they want that energy. That's not me every day. I can extract it immediately when I need to because when you train alone and I lived alone for so many years in this misery and you're able to get out of it by yourself. I can take myself to such a level of real real passion and purpose. It's about [ __ ] This ain't no joke. This ain't no game. Who's going to carry the [ __ ] boats in the logs? I am [ __ ] I am, [ __ ] I am, [ __ ]  Get up, [ __ ] You're not [ __ ] good enough. You got to work [ __ ] harder. You haven't put enough time in.  They don't know me, son.  Get it. A  They don't know me, son. Get it. 19.  They don't know me, son.  There's several days I don't want to do [ __ ] I procrastinate like a [ __ ] This is one of those days, man. I put my shoes and my socks and my shorts on every day. Woke up this morning, just stared at them. Didn't want to do [ __ ] Didn't know why I was doing the [ __ ] A lot of times we forget just how badass we are. So what I do and I've done for so many years is I write down I've been writing. So this book right here, this is just about three year book, but I've been writing down for years what I've do. So, open up to a page today, look at it, and I go through looking at 18 mi, 16 mi, 17 mi, 15 m, 16, 116 mile week, 123 mile week, 20, 20, 18, 16. All by myself, training alone, [ __ ] push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, all this [ __ ] I write down here to remind me of the work I put into the craft that is myself. So we have to always remember our purpose will always be there. I have nothing in front of me right now. No race, no nothing. But the purpose is myself. Your mind has to be stronger than your feelings. On those bad days when you think that you're alone, you just might be. Cuz you know why? No one else wants to [ __ ] do it. Should you be the [ __ ] that always gets it done? Stay hard.  You had nobody anyway, [ __ ] Look around you. There was no [ __ ] team. It was you. There was no weight loss program or mom and dad waking you up saying you can do it. You can be better trying to build belief. You built belief when you had nothing. Rock bottom. Out of the hundred men that go into war, 10 shouldn't even [ __ ] be there. 80 of them are just targets. 10 do most of or nine do most the fighting. One is a warrior. I struggled in class. So I picked the far back desk to sit in hoping I never get caught on. I got exposed. When I was in the military, I was afraid of the water. I got exposed in that. A lot of us are trying to find that back seat in the classroom of life, hoping we never get called on. Trust me, you will get called on. Your fears will always find you. They'll know where you're hiding. When you're in that tunnel of life, it's dark as [ __ ] There may not be a light, but you have the courage to stay there long enough. You can make out objects. And you can make out objects. You can see a way to get the [ __ ] out of that tunnel. Stay hard. Stay savage.  That competition is you versus you. When that alarm clock goes off, it's time to get after it. It's going to be you and your mind. That's when the demon comes out. Talk to you today. Go back to sleep, [ __ ] Stay home. Stay in the fight and get the [ __ ] up. So when your plan fails, when those boling [ __ ] laws get too heavy, when you get knocked the [ __ ] down in the [ __ ] canvas, when everything falls apart in your life and your plan is [ __ ] up, what the [ __ ] are you going to do? There's only one [ __ ] option. Stay [ __ ] hard. What the hell are we all waiting for to start attacking life? Waiting for the [ __ ] stars to align. Back when I was growing up, the song came out. All I need is a miracle. Well, guess what? That miracle ain't coming. There is no perfect time to start. You got to start now with changing your life. We're all being tested in life. And guess what? This is one test you can't cheat on. We all have our own test. Some of us are obese. Some of us depressed. Some of us insecure. In the military, we had this big old rut sack on the back. have batteries, water, extra gear. Your extra gear is the [ __ ] you're dealing with in life. And the only way to overcome it is for you and you alone to face it. You got to do your best work when you're the least motivated. So those days you don't want to do it, guess what you got to do. You got to suck it the [ __ ] up and do it. Stay hard. Work your ass off so so you can enjoy. Yeah. Yeah. You're taking a shot. You know, you you may not live to be old, but what if you do? and you worked your ass off when you were able and you were able to [ __ ] get up early, able to grind. If you frontload it properly, the back half of your [ __ ] life is money. Hard work looks horrible. It's not motivating. It's not motivating at all. It ain't like Rocky round 14. He gets knocked down. He goes like this to Apollo Creed. Looks like a man being stuck in a [ __ ] dungeon and there's no [ __ ] way out. But you had the [ __ ] key, but you refused to use it. There's a saying out there in the military. They say first time every time. Well, I wasn't that guy. I failed everything I did the first time. I was known for coming back even harder after I failed. Success isn't a straight line. It's a maze. And when you think you figure that maze out, you hit a wall and you got to turn the [ __ ] around and start again.  Today is your opportunity to be a leader. You must look at yourself as a leader. As a leader, you no longer have the [ __ ] option to take the easy path in life. As a leader, there is no snooze button. It can be very lonely. Through your actions, you can change the mindset of those around you. You must do when you don't want to do. You have to find your best self when you are the least motivated. Your brain is like a muscle. You have to push it to a point of discomfort. All those days and nights you don't want to train, those are the days you must train. You must change the way you look at discomfort. Right now in life, your family is looking for that one guy right now. They're looking for that one guy who's strong, who's that pillar for the family in hard times. Make sure they look around. They look around and find you. These are the times right now for you to step up. Be that guy that can take anything. Stay hard. There's so many times in life you don't want to be doing what the [ __ ] you're doing. You can't just [ __ ] quit. Remember this. It's in a hobby. It's in the [ __ ] joke. It's a [ __ ] lifestyle. So, what you say to yourself is important. There's no [ __ ] coach. There's no trainer to keep you going. It's only you. So, think about this. You've been working your whole life to get a [ __ ] seat at the table. The seat at the table. You want to be the best amongst all the best people in your [ __ ] career field. So, you finally get that letter. It's steak lobster. It's a big dinner. Everybody's showing up dressed to the nines. Make sure you show up soaking wet for [ __ ] getting after it. working out hard, towel around your neck, you respect the event, so make sure you put that towel over that nice chair so you don't [ __ ] it up. The whole thing is this. Don't say a word. Stay uncommon amongst uncommon people. You're never done. Don't stop when you're tired. Stop when you're done. Stay hard.  So, a lot of people ask me what it's like to live with David. And I figured I had the perfect opportunity tonight to just give a little bit of insight. So today, just randomly, David says after we come home from the gym that he was going to go on a 100mile ruck tonight. So unplanned, just spur of the moment, we're out here. We left just about 12 and 1/2 hours ago or just over 12 Oh god, that's blurry. 12:43 a.m. It's 38° and he's about 60 or 60ome miles in at this point. I haven't spoken to him in a few hours other than to give him my socks because it's cold and he has rainods. So, he's wearing them as his gloves. And, you know, it's lonely as hell. Uh, no one's out here. It's just me. No one would even know he's doing this if I wasn't recording this video. And that's so much of his life. Just all of the unseen work that goes into being David. Uh, I don't think people can even imagine the discipline and the hours spent alone just grinding. And the other thing people can't imagine is the pain and discomfort that goes into it. You know, every day when he starts running, it's like the first few miles he's just hobbling along. Um, and you know, I know he's just 3 months post surgery. Uh, three and a half months ago, I wrote to a surgeon. It was end of September and I said, you know, David was going to come in for surgery and he said, well, I just hope he's not jumping out of planes. Well, he sure was. He was in British Columbia jumping out of planes.
