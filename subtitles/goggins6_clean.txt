But guess what happens? That alarm clock goes off at 4:00 a.m. to train. I don't want to be a seal today or I don't want to be whatever today. I'll start tomorrow. You hate me because you're probably in the bed right now. You're probably an underachiever. You're probably somebody who doesn't want to do anything with your life.  So I make you question everything about yourself. One thing I did wrong in my life was I tried for so many years to please people and I did it at the expense of myself. I was leaving a lot in the tank and I  and when you do that you stop living and you will I had to stop thinking normal. I had to stop thinking normal. I can no longer be a common man walking around doing common things. But no one taught me this stuff. It wasn't like I had, you know, I paid a trainer to come train me. Jenny Craig didn't come down and miracle my ass. None of this happened. It was on me. I became obsessed. I became obsessed with being the baddest [ __ ] that God ever created. Am I that? I don't care. I believe it. And I was trying to tell him once you become obsessed with something, obsessed. It's okay to be unbalanced for a while. It's okay. Don't be all this stuff. People say you got to be balanced to be the best in the world at what you do. It's not about being a Navy Seal, people.  The best at what you do, you have to be unbalanced to find every bit of [ __ ] energy and strength that you have to pull it off. I don't look at anything as failure because when you're willing to try to do something, not trying is failure. That's that's and that's not some after school special [ __ ] but when you're able to go out there, there there is no failure.  It's attempts. Cuz when you're trying to do something that's bigger than you, whatever you are, whoever you are, if if if you're paralyzed, you're trying to walk one step and you didn't. You didn't fail, [ __ ] That was your first attempt. If that's your biggest thing, that's how your mindset needs to go into everything. So, I don't look at it as failure is a big word like that gets people down and [ __ ] We give so much power to words. I don't no one's going to miracle me to be somebody special. Everybody that called me [ __ ] my dad, my mom, all my situations were on me now and solely on me. In 2013, people wanted me to write my book. Failure is the ultimate thing, man. I failed so many times before. That's why I don't look at failure anymore as failure. I look as my first, second, and third attempt. To be at the point of your life where  you don't care about being judged. You can be in a room of a million people and they all hate you and you walk in and you go like this because not because you're angry at them, because you know yourself  inside and out and you know that you've put yourself through hell to be where you're at today. You've walked the walk. You've talked the talk and you've walked the walk. And  that's to me what it's all about. You have to make the decision whether you want to be a badass or whether you want just want to be mediocre and everything's okay. A good painter will not just paint. He needs to create. And you can't create with phones and everything going around you. So, you got to block yourself off. You only do two podcasts in a year. you block yourself off and you're and you're painting this thing inside and you're going through all these different colors of paint and everything else and you can only figure out the right painting if you spend the correct amount of time in your brain. You have to face that in that dark room. In that dark room is who you are. But in that dark room is where you have to create another human being that walks out of that dark room to face who you are.  That's the only way you're going to get over all those things. So basically, a lot of us aren't prepared for life. We get up willy-nilly and just hope life is going to happen. It is  going to happen, but it's going to happen with a prepared mind or an unprepared mind. Most people attack life with the unprepared mind. What I do is I try to account for all things that could happen, might happen, probably will happen, and then the unknowns. Whenever you think you can't, confidence comes from the thing that you built. You must build belief. You must build confidence. It can't be like, 'Hey, um, I'm going to go knock that [ __ ] out.' You got to look over here and say, 'I can knock that [ __ ] out.' It's a belief and it's built on what you put in to yourself. I had to miserably wake up every morning in the cold cuz it was Indiana, November when it started. I was miserable.  This is your new life. Take it or leave it. There's no happiness about it. There's no peace behind it. It sucks. You got to live with that. I live with it for a lot of years until I sat back and said, 'Okay, all right. I know  what this takes.' And when you sit back,  as [ __ ] up as I was, and I had a laundry list, a a table like this of what I have to do to become just a human being. I understand that guy. I understand exactly where you're coming from. That is your personal opinion and I totally get that. But there's very few people in this world who want to do a job like that. And it takes a different kind of mindset.  Is it tear grass appropriate? I don't know how hard that training is. I don't expect anybody to understand it. But 1%. But the loud voices of this world are the 99% who don't understand exactly what you have to do. I was I became the most obsessed person on the planet earth. And I was basically I had to invent a guy that didn't exist. I lived a life so disciplined that everybody I don't quit. You know, I may not make it the first time,  but I'll come back. I got to call on audible. I got to [ __ ] I got to I got to [ __ ] get my head back in the game. I got to I got to figure this [ __ ] out. It doesn't mean you leave. It means you study it more. When do you rest?  When do you recover? Yeah.  And I don't want to scare people,  but the truth answer is I don't take any days off that I turned a person this [ __ ] up into this [ __ ] right here. Not off of reading a [ __ ] book off a theorist, off of going to work on myself and saying, 'I don't know how to do this.' But I know that to get over there to that [ __ ] side, I got to grind myself into a [ __ ] fine power. And I did it. If you want to be great, you want to be badass [ __ ] ever at what you do, you're going to be misunderstood by everybody because you're going to be so [ __ ] obsessed and so driven to get there. And that's what it takes.  That's the truth.  Takes every second of your [ __ ] life. Anybody says balance, yeah, balance is important for a lot of [ __ ] people. It is. But if you want to [ __ ] go to that edge where people do not like you, don't understand you, question everything you [ __ ] do, you you've arrived. You just can't read about it. You  can't sit back and be a theorist. You have to be a [ __ ] practitioner.  At the end of the day, I ask myself one question. Can I take one more step? And usually the answer is yes. So if you can answer that question and not take another step, that is real failure. That is real quitting. So a lot of people can take one more step and they choose not to. I don't know if you can take two steps. You got to answer that question after you take the first step. But I can always take one more step. So if I choose not to, that's on me. And I got to live with that. Are you happy? What's wrong with you? I'm driven. I'm obsessed. And that's what you see. Failure is the ultimate thing, man. I failed so many times before. That's why I don't look at failure anymore as failure. I look as my first, second, and third attempt. How you going to feel, man, when you accomplish this goal coming from that [ __ ] coming from the [ __ ] hell you came from? A lot of people start from a good starting point. They have a good foundation. What if you can surpass all of these [ __ ] We have everybody who was [ __ ] way up here. Started up here and you had you started with no legs. You had to grow [ __ ] legs to even start walking and then crawling and then running and then you start passing people and all this given to them. I had to use all this negative [ __ ] that was making me weak and horrible as a person. I had to use this as the power that now fueled me. I had to flip it on its head and say, 'Hold up. This might be exactly what I need.'  For for me, I I made a decision and my decision was to be the best person I could. And I basically a lot of mornings I wake up and say, 'Fuck your feelings.' And that doesn't mean like, you know, don't take it literally, [ __ ] your feelings. But sometimes  you have to go beyond what you're feeling. and my knees were [ __ ] But guess what? I wanted to run.  I have to change because I I can't stay here.  I can't I I looked at myself in the mirror and I was defeated. I go, 'Look, look at myself.' I'm like, 'Who am I?' So, I know why you go on Instagram. I know why you cuz you just have the time. You have the time because you don't want to put that time into bettering oneself. I had two options to either be that 300lb guy who sprayed for cockroaches and made $1,000 a month and at 24 years old knowing when I'm 50 [ __ ] years old I can reflect on this and think about what guy I never became or I can totally just sack it up and fail and fail and fail until I succeed. Let me teach you the real life how it really is. The reason why you you're alone. You're alone. You may have a shrink you're going to. You may have a best friend you're going to, but there's 24 hours in the day where you're alone in this brain. And your brain is talking to you in all kind of ways and it wants to control you and pull you in these different pockets. If you can't control your own brain and  your brain controls you, you're [ __ ] You got to tell your brain where you want to go and how you want to go and how you want to  get there. You got to control it. If not, it's over. But you're also the scientist because I'm looking for that person like me. I sat down at a table and I said to myself, what are you willing to give up? Everything. And when people come to me with that kind of ma mindset, I can work with you. When you are willing to strip yourself down to nothing and give everything, that's who I want to work with because now I can mold you into exactly who you want to be. When you put these restrictions up and that's why that's why my first question is, how bad do you want this? If it's as bad as you want to live or breathe or sleep, whatever the hell it may be, I can work with you. So, you better figure out who the [ __ ] you are on this journey. And those few people who don't many people don't like you, so be it. But you first have to figure out you because a lot of people die with a lot of untapped potential because they're trying to be somebody that they're not. Yeah.  So, I was able to figure out my own potential by figuring out me. The mind controls everything. So what I realized was that when I was growing up and I was 300 lb and I got all fat and I got all insecure. I realized that my mind kept taking me in this direction when things got uncomfortable for me. When I was facing my insecurities, I was facing my fears. My mind said, 'Oh no, we have the tactical advantage. We need to get you separate you from this feeling. This feeling over here. Life's all about feelings. We want the happy feeling. We don't want that feeling of this sucks. Why am I here?' and you don't have any so so you can't answer those questions so you leave. I started realizing that if in that moment, you can answer those [ __ ] up questions and you are now in charge of your brain versus your brain ruling you. That's where all that stuff comes from. So, so, so the 40% rule is all of that. You get to 40%,  your brain says, 'We're done. Let's roll. Man, this is starting to get painful. This is uncomfortable.' So, you sit down. You have to figure out ways and everybody's different. That's how the book kind of talks about like we all have these things about, you know, five steps to this and and four steps to this. It's it's a lot more than that. That's all [ __ ] It's it's a practice that you have to it's a habit. So, if you know that at 40% I'm still, you know, I'm feeling pain.  At 40% I'm feeling pain. That's where the 40% rule kicks in. Now, it starts, okay, I'm I'm feeling pain. My mind's saying all this [ __ ] to me. is saying, 'Get out of here. Run. Flee.' The fight or flight kicks in. Okay, we're done. We're not good enough. It starts telling you all these things. You start to believe it because the mind controls all. This is the time where you have to gain control back of your mind and say, 'Okay, let me see if I can go 45%.' And once you start giving yourself more and more hope and start realizing, okay, the mind starts to be, okay, what are you doing? We're supposed to be going right and you're going left. you start then controlling your mind, start finding more in, you know, in yourself and it goes from 40% to a lot further than that. But that's the start of it though. Get to get to the spot where your mind is saying stop.  Whatever that is, got to get there first. And then that's when that [ __ ] starts to work for you. What is your biggest fear? Why are you paralyzed? What what makes you nervous to just go out there and just be who you are and do what you have to do? You had nobody anyway, [ __ ] We're not able to think. The the most powerful weapon in the world. We walk around with it.  It's our mind. It's our brain. You have to be able to go into a very dark place in your mind  and figure who you are. go back to what you want to do. What's your purpose? We can't figure our purpose out or why we're here or why we're even born or whatever because our it's so loud in our mind. We don't have any quiet time with ourselves to sit back and say, 'What do I really want?' There's so many different dialogues in our head that we can't think. So, my biggest thing is you have to be alone in a very dark place in your mind to think about what is important to you. You can [ __ ] achieve the absolute impossible. You don't need great parents. You don't need like a private school. You don't need to have this humongous GPA and all this other [ __ ] What you need is the one thing I talk about in my book, which is straight up brutal work ethic. There's no hacks, bro. It's you against you. You against you. And if you miss something, pretty soon you win. Pretty soon you'll [ __ ] win. If you have the courage and the heart and the dedication and the mindset about everybody can go [ __ ] themselves.  I know what I know. I've listened to myself enough to know I know what I know. In the battle, in the battle, you find peace. When you go to war with yourself, you find a lot of peace because you know exactly who you are. And that is where the peace is really found for me. It's so easy to be great nowadays, my friend. Cuz most people are weak. Most people don't want to go to that extra mile. Most people don't want to find that extra cuz  it sucks. Every day I walk this earth and I see average all over the [ __ ] place. Know that if you have big goals and big dreams  along the way failure is going to happen. So how fast do you get up from that and you got to teach yourself  that it's time to get back to work. Stop hearing yourself talk. Get off the podcast. Don't be on social media too much. Cut out all the [ __ ] noise. Get back to the [ __ ] mental
