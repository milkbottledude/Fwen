like 4 hours.
>> No, just a little sample. Just a little
sample. Just a little
>> Yeah. Little or
>> I think they add stuff new like new
stuff to the game pretty often.
>> Yeah. Which is surprising cuz I'm pretty
sure I read at first that they were
like, "We're not going to update this
anyway. Bye."
>> Oh, wait. I think I see a big
watermelon.
>> Didn't they do that? The devs, they
posted the game and then they said,
"Anyway, vacation. Bye-bye."
>> Really?
>> Yeah. And then the game blew up and
they're like, "What?"
Oh, okay. Yeah, but the map updates
every day, right? So, I guess it's just
automatic. It's not like somebody
sitting there and building every map by
hand, right? Hey, I thought I was
wondering if it was like what you say
procedurally proced
procedurally generated, but then how
would it know how would it know to make
specific paths? Like would it wouldn't
you eventually get a version that is
just like oh it's 14 handpicked maps.
Ah, okay.
I thought this was a watermelon, but
it's not.
>> It's a bush.
>> Yeah.
>> All right.
Bush. To the pig. To the pig.
To the pig.
Oh, wait.
This is spooky. What do you mean? I
don't know. The ambience is really loud
for me. It's like It's like Minecraft
music. Like,

uh scout rule?
Uh, hold hands.
Close. A scout never leaves another
scout behind.

>> One. Whole.
So take two halves.
>> Okay. Yeah, the weight is taking up like
one/ird of my stamina bar.
>> Can I take anything out?
>> Nah, it's okay.
>> Okay. What difficulty is this?
>> Uh just a normal one, I think. Oh my
god, the RNG, dude. I got a Oh,
I was trying not to step on that. I got
a kids cuisine. Cake cuisine
with the blue pudding.
>> All right, what do we not need? I don't
think we need a shoot. I think we I'm
just going to hold this.
All right, what else do we got? Trail
mix.
Quick, eat it before your scout mates
can ask questions.
>> Wait, the coconut.
>> I need that.
>> Eat some of these.
Oh. Ooh, thick thick mint.
Oh, you feeding me?

why they keep doing it is cuz they make
money.
>> Yeah, but if Disney is so sensitive and
and protective of their music, wouldn't
they be also protective of their IP
being used in such a way?
>> I don't think so.
Well, I don't know. There was that
thing. It was messed up where they like
somebody put Spider-Man in like a
cemetery and they're like, "No, you

oven sucks. Um cuz it never it doesn't
hold the heat, so you can never really
tell when it's going to bake something
or if it's going to screw it up. But
anyway, I made a
lemon poppy seed cake.

layers. And then I put a layer of
strawberry jam. And then I put a layer
of uh vanilla whipped cream. And then a
layer of fresh strawberries. And then
another little layer of whipped cream.
And then I put the other the the other
part on top. And then I dusted it with
powdered sugar. It is so good.

My ears will fit inside of the gnome hat
pretty well.
Oh, yeah. There's like an X-ray scan of
your gnome hat and it's the ears like
shoved into the Yeah. Or like a a a
dunce cap or something. It sits right
perfectly with your ears underneath.
>> Why a dunce cap?
>> I don't know.
>> What would your costume be?
>> I guess if if I'm the gnome, what does
that make you?
>> Uh
something. Oh, maybe like a wizard.
>> Why do you get to be the wizard?
>> Gnomes have magical powers, too.
>> They do.
>> Think I don't know. Does anybody who has
like gnome folklore in their country?
Does anybody know?
>> What do the gnomes do?
>> I thought they just in the garden.
>> What do they do?
>> You know, there's people who actually
believe that gnomes exist and there's
like security footage of little gnome
people walking on camera.
Maybe you can exterminate them the same
way you do in Reaper.
>> Why?
>> You grab them and you smash them against
the sidewalk.
>> That's why they don't show themselves.
Because of people like you.
>> Don't they bite?
>> Cuz people like me. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait, wait, wait,
wait.
Maybe they they don't tell you what the
magic is. They're just like, "Yeah,

don't they don't elaborate at all ever.
Wendes.
Wendes. Huh?
I don't know.
[Music]
>> I think a gnome would be cute. I want to

I'm not going to say it in case so
nobody nobody steals it.
>> Okay.
>> I think I already told you though at
some point.
>> Maybe. Hey, I do know we had this
conversation, but I can't remember.
Make a note, though, cuz I I want to I
want to
What if we're both homes? Wait.
>> Oh, we could be like Noia with Juliet.
>> Wait, that would be cute.
>> Don't collab for that movie. You put
stuff in my bag.
>> Here.
That seems that feels like one of those
games that had those like like movies
that had one of those tie-in games. Was
there a Romeo and Juliet game?
>> I think so. Well, cuz it's Isn't it by
the same studio as Over the Hedge?
>> Yeah, I was just thinking that.
>> I played that.
>> There was a Overhead. Yeah. Yeah, they
had it for PlayStation, too.

>> Yeah.
>> Uh,
>> I don't know. Chat, back. Check. Who's
Bruce Willis in Over the Edge?

the cast for that movie and was
surprised by how many of the names that
I recognized.
>> Oh, yeah. They said, "Yeah,
>> clues die hard."
>> What?
There's a uh there's some uh check mix
over there or something.
>> Trail mix.
>> Trail mix.

>> Hey, we didn't get an empty rope this
time. I have rope.
It's regular rope.
>> Rope though. Yeah,

or I feel like are more Christmas
themed?
>> Yeah.
>> Wait, where do we go from here?
>> What if I'm a gnome with teeth and an
attitude? That could be scary.
>> I think I think all gnomes have teeth.
>> What a terrifying thought.
How How else are they going to eat?
>> Oh, you mean like regular teeth? I meant
like serrated teeth. Wait, that's a
>> I think a gnome without teeth is an even
worse. That's
>> Wait, don't they cut your grass for you?
Maybe they just gum your grass.
>> Yeah, like a Some people have like a
tortoise company or like a goat company
and then they bring goats over.
>> Yeah. Yeah, you can do that with
bunnies, too.
>> Oh, really? Bunnies.
>> If you make like a clover lawn and then
you get some bunnies, maybe a little bit
dark, but people are people say that
bunnies are a really good source of what
is it? Would you say livestock
cuz they reproduce really quickly and
then you can eat them a lot quicker and
then you can pretty much just have them
cut your clover lawn and then it's like
a really easy,
how do I say this? food loop. A seamless
food loop.
>> You could be a lawn mower cuz you have
like a like your tail could be like the
handle and
are my ears.
Oh, how that snip snip.
Oh, snip snip.
[Music]
I feel like we've been here before.
>> Yeah, like two or three times.

bit more if you than if you were to
resell your knife.
I don't think so. You can get a sewing
kit at the 99 cent store.
>> True.
Is it a custom knife with your scout
number on it?

Come on, just climb through the hole.
Come on, Saba. Just just climb through
the hole.
Only your head wasn't so big.

What do we do? You want to do another
one or should we should we should we
>> What if we do another one? Uh if we try
going like So on the jungle, we have the
right path. But what if uh we take the
right path, you know, like on the right
in the ice area?
>> Yeah, we should go right in the ice
because I think left is just
that.
We'll zigzag. We'll go right and then
left.
>> Yeah, that sounds like it should work.
>> Okay.
[Music]

Put it in my bag for now. I think on the
ice like don't use your bag cuz uh for
some reason I know it's like a bug.
>> No, no, no, no. If you put your bag down
on the ice, it like bounces off like
>> Well, I was trying to maybe I I was
trying to put it in a corner so that it
wouldn't roll off. But maybe it just
>> Yeah.
>> glitched out and catapulted.
>> It might be like the map geometry, too.
So, if you put it in a corner, it might
make it worse.
>> Can you carry me up the first mountain?
>> I was going to ask you that.
We already know the path thing. Can
somebody
>> I'm surprised you can't carry your
teammates just from the like the get-
go. Like they have to be passed out.
That would be kind of fun if you could
just pick somebody up.
>> Yeah. Wait, you can't pick me up if I do
this.
>> No.
Feels like you picked me up. Look like
it on my side kind of. You can take your
stuff, though.

didn't know that there are mods for this
game. That makes sense, though.
>> What kind of mod?
>> Uh, I guess a mod where you can carry
your teammate. What other mods are
there, chat?
>> Put me in the backpack. Oh, that would
be awesome if you could put your
teammate in the backpack.
