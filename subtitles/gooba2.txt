How do we get out of here though? Oh
well.
>> Get out of Oh. Uh, I think there's a
jump pad. Oh, those are explosive

or marbles.
Excellent marbles. Is it a maze?
Oo. Dumpad.
Two marbles.
Marbles. Marbles.

Here. Here. You can make a potion with
it. Oh, true. I bet you can make
invisibility potion. That'd be nice.
There has to be a way. And we have to
figure out how to shrink ourselves so we
can go in the the little tiny door.
There's got to be like some recipe book
somewhere. We just haven't read.
>> Guys, where's the recipe book? Wait, I
want to check what this is over here.
Okay, put it in the soup.
Ubie's using banish weed in the dorms.

die. Where is he? There he is. I know.
I'll just follow him.
>> Oh, sure. I got it. We'll just drop like
a comically large barrel on his head and
he'll die. I like that idea.

All right, hold on though. I got to get
a wire really quick.
>> Okay,
we are uh switching games, guys. So,
that game was
[Music]
Uh, Secret Agent Wizard Boy of Wait,
Secret Agent Wizard Boy and the
International Crime Syndicate.
Um, but now we're changing games. We're
going to play
and what is it called? Mage Arena. Whoa,
two games.
And do we have to go get a cable?
Yeah,
another game. No way.
Yeah, Major is pretty funny cuz
Well, it's funny, but we weren't really
sure how much playability we would get
with just us. So,
we'll have to see.
You thought that was Mage Arena?
Major arena is going to have us yelling
now. We're going to be yelling fireball
fireball. Full bolt. Fire thunder rain.
Yeah. Um, major arena. You have to use
your voice. It's a voice activated game.
[Music]
Let me
[Music]
Baby,
[Music]
do you guys like my wizard hat? Doobie
got it for me.
[Music]
Okay, the funny thing about this is
people with non-American accents, please
click here.
The only available languages currently
is English. Multiple languages will be
available later. Unfortunately, accents
can cause the voice detection to not
work as well. If you do not have one of
the following accents, try out all
three. See, they originally had
American, British, and Indian. Um,
but British has been disabled. It did
not work for anyone. Just I don't know
why I think that's so funny.
So, the two accents you can have are
American or Indian, which is I don't
know. I just think that's
charming in a way. British doesn't work
for British didn't work for anyone.
But there's like 60 British accents. I
don't know.
I don't know. You guys have to, if
you're British and you play this game,
you have to do your best American
accent.
Hello.
>> Hello. Sorry, I had to use my liquid
spell in my handwashing spell.
Your liquid spells
Maximus.
Oh. Uh, so for this game, mage arena, we
can do 1 v one or we can do like a
bigger lobby 1 v one, but then we can
just explore instead of killing each
other if you want to try that. And then
we can try one v one at the end. Do we
have to add other people to our
multiplayer lobby?
Uh, I don't think so. Hold on. I'll make
the lobby. Make a private lobby cuz I'm
pretty sure we don't want other people
in our lobby. I think they will be
screaming. It automatically hides the
lobby ID. Oh, it does.
>> Yeah.
>> I don't think we should have other
people in the lobby, though.
>> No, no, no, no.
>> I don't trust the wizard skills.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah.
>> Huh?
>> Huh?
>> What
>> is it working? Oh, shoot. I don't know
if my voice detection is working. Hold
on. I got to check something.
>> Okay, I I'll read these tips. We have
tips for it. Um, say your spell once. Do
not say it over and over. Your
microphone peeking for too long will
cause the voice recognition to fail.
Place your mic further away from you if
you want to scream. Do not scream
directly into your microphone. The game
has to use your Windows default
microphone.
Okay. So, don't uh scream as much as you
can help it. Fireball.
Randos are going to bring some forbidden
spells. You know, that's that's what
I've been hearing.
Some unsavory spells from fake wizards,
false wizards,
magic missile.
What's some other spells?
Frozen.
Obliteral.
Obliteral
magic.
Magic.
Wind burst.
Expel air.
I'm excited. I haven't played this. I
tried the tutorial.
Oh, good. Nice.
>> Is it working?
Uh, hold on. Test. Test.
I can hear.
>> Test test.
Testing. Okay. Yeah, I think it's
working.
>> It's kind of like capture the flag if
you play it in a big lobby with however
many people.
>> Yeah, I think it's 4v4 and I I think
that's the best way to play it. But
since it's just the two of us, I think
we can just explore cuz there's like
different uh there's different spells
and crafting, too.
>> Okay.
>> Do you know how to do crafting? Cuz I
think it was part of tutorial, but uh I
didn't put the tutorial, actually.
>> Um I only played the first 30 seconds of
the tutorial.
>> Okay, we'll we'll figure it out.
>> Wait, the why why you only played the
first 30 seconds? Well, because the
little troll man who was giving me the
tutorial stopped talking to me, so I
left. I figured he didn't want to talk
to me anymore.
>> Oh, okay.
>> I raised the flag and then he said
nothing else, so I left.
>> Uh-huh.
Okay.
>> Make the room.
All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let
me check one thing. One. 10 more
seconds.
>> Okay.
Automatic breathing. Manual breathing.
Manual blinking. Manual breathing
doesn't work on me because that's how I
make myself fall asleep then sometimes.
If you just breathe repeatedly and
heavily
uh it makes you sleepy.
Too much too much oxygen.
>> Okay, I'm back.
>> Go to bed faster. Hi.
>> Hi.
Uh,
>> I don't know if you're a mouth breather.
>> I I Do you ever fall asleep and find
yourself uh with your mouth open while
you're sleeping? Like wide open?
>> Maybe. Like if I fall asleep in a car or
the or like on an airplane.
>> Uhhuh.
>> Yes.
>> Oh, that's the worst in the airplane.
You're getting all those people germs
out in all up on your
>> I know.
>> Gums.
That's why you have to you have to
travel with a big big like trucker hat
on, like an oversized baseball hat,
>> so you can lay it over your face so you
don't have to worry.
>> Oh, you know some people get mouth tape
and they like tape their mouth shut
while they sleep.
>> I pull out my sewing kit. Hold on a
second. I just got to sew my mouth shut
so I don't breathe on you.
Fellow
>> pressure. I feel like it's perfectly
normal to use though.
Maybe.
>> Is it?
>> Hey. Yeah.
>> Mouth type.
>> Yeah.
>> Are you going to get weird looks? Well,
maybe.
>> No, it's not like um I think it's
normal.
>> Yeah.
>> Check. Check. Okay. Sorry. I was just
checking my microphone.
>> I'm starting the lobby. Okay.
>> Well, I've never heard of mouth tape, so
It's like a beauty thing. People will
uh only sleep with a neck pillow only
facing up. Uh put like the beauty eye
masks on and then put mouth tape on cuz
that it's supposed to like help shape
your face.
>> What? All this stuff. Yeah. Oh, wait. I
knew about sleeping on your back
because Yeah. If you put your if you
sleep on your side, you're going to get
premature wrinkles.
And if you sleep on a non-silk
pillowcase, it's gonna cause breakage to
your hair.
>> Oh, can I send you a Steam message? It's
not going to show up on stream, is it?
It's the It's the ID for the thing.
>> I have it all hidden. Don't worry,
you're good.
>> Okay, you have to put that ID in to
connect.
>> Um, okay.
Sleep paralysis from sleeping on your
bag. Have you ever got sleep paralysis?
>> Yes. Oh my god,
>> it sucks. It sucks so bad.
>> I like self-induced it cuz I was reading
about it a lot and I'm like, "Huh, I
wonder how this feels." And then a few
nights later, I I had it. It's like my
brain was like, "Here you go, Doobie.
Check this out."
>> Oh, so Duby, I heard you wanted to heal.
I wanted you wanted to experience real
sleep paralysis.
>> What did your demon look like?
I I just heard noises like I heard
someone speaking
>> in a deep voice.
>> E
did you have one that looked like
something?
>> No, I remember
um I was in like I was in like a moving
vehicle or so
and I was trying to
breathe but I couldn't breathe. So, I
just started making noise going like
like something was choking me or I was
suffocating and I started to scream to
wake myself up but I couldn't do it.
>> That's scary. It only happened once,
right?
>> Yes.
>> Okay.
>> Hopefully you don't induce it again
after talking about it.
>> Oh, that would be terrible. I would hate
it very much. Wait.
>> Oh. Uh, you can join warlocks.
I am a sorcerer. Oh, my robe's cooler.
Oh, you can make a edit team flag and
then this is the flag that shows up on
the flag pole. But we're not really
going to be playing capture the flag.
This is just for fun if you want to draw
something.
[Music]
>> Yeah,

you know.
>> Okay.
>> Only erase.
>> Yes.
Oh, have you played Wiggle Paint?
>> Wiggle Paint?
>> Yeah.
>> Is that like a finger painting thing?
>> It's like um I don't know if it's like a
like a H dial thingy.
>> Oh, okay. But it's a painting service,
but it has all the old old early 2000s
or or late '9s like MP3s. Like when you
draw it wiggles, it has like line boil,
but it makes sounds like
and then when you fill them with like a
paint bucket, it goes split
that you know so well.
>> Yeah. Yeah, I think I know what you're
talking about. Yeah, that
>> sounds nice. It's just for It's just for
nostalgia purposes.
>> Yes.
How

taking a while.
>> No, I'm also taking a while.
>> Okay. Okay. Okay.

real life?
>> No, but I wanted to Do you I wanted to I
wanted to be the one that they picked.
If you go to the theme park and then
they pick you

Oh yeah.
>> A
>> I was in one of those one time, but then
my phone started ringing and they
everybody looked at me in the room
because they said like this thing that
was like, "Hey everybody, turn your
phones off so we don't disrupt the
show." And I'm like, "I don't get calls
anyways. Nobody calls me. Who I I'm not
going to do it." And then like 10 like
five minutes into the beginning of the
thing, it started going off and it's
like what you know that picture where
everybody stares at you like everybody's
holding their cups and they all turn to
look. Yes.
>> Yeah. I was like that and then I just
left because I was embarrassed.

stuff with it? What did you do with it?
>> I like cast spells and stuff and it was
like they came true.
>> Like which ones can you can you?
>> Uh I don't remember. I I think I might
have used a memory erase spell on myself
at some point.
>> Ah I understand. A true wizard never
reveals his spells.
I have like a really bad memory kind of
for remembering things from a long time
ago, you know.
>> Uhhuh.
>> But I've always been like that. It's
always It's not like a new recent thing.
It's just like I only remember big
events type of thing.

life. What?
>> I'm insane.
