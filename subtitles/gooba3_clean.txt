Do you think your saliva is hot enough to steep coffee? >> A what? Is your saliva hot enough to steep coffee? >> Well, I mean, you can do cold brew coffee where people leave the coffee in in the water overnight. So, probably you just have to leave it in your mouth for a really long time then. So, technically you could do a coffee taste testing stream by just putting the grounds directly on your tongue and letting it sit and then you can do like that like that that Edy's ice cream taste test video where he's like, 'Oh, vanilla vanilla airy.' You can do that with coffee. Like ground coffee. Yeah, I like folders and Duncan. >> Dunkin Dunkin Donuts. >> Dunkin Donuts. >> Oh, I thought you meant Hold on. I'm setting up the lobby.

They don't even taste like chocolate. They just taste like bark. And they're hard. Hard bark. No thanks. >> Isn't it healthy, though? Is it good for you? >> They say it is. But maybe it's all just a Maybe it's foe. Maybe it's a lie to sell people. So they laugh at you and say you're eating tree bark. >> Maybe it's will the foe. No, he would never.

It is difficult though because isn't it like on uh like on Twitch or so you can you can change your game. I guess you could do that here, too, but you'd have to have a whole new thumbnail. Ready? Maybe. I don't know. Maybe I'm putting too much thought behind it. Yeah. You just change your game category here, too. Yeah. Yeah.  I will be better at Wheel of Fortune. I'm actually I'm okay at Wheel of Fortune. You saw it. I'm decent.  Yeah, pretty good. Not great, but it'll work. It'll work in a pinch.  Have I baked anything recently?

People could shake my hand. >> You have the arm? >> No, I don't have it. I don't know where it is. It's in someone's storage. I guess >> you could like You should put that up somewhere. >> Put it up. Chun. >> You could do that. >> What do you mean? Put it up like for like display. >> Yeah. Like a decoration. >> Yeah. >> Your blown up half arm. >> Yeah. Yeah. It could be a like a pillow instead of like the you know the arm pillow. >> Yeah. Yeah. Like like the boyfriend pillow that wraps around the >> arm. The giant inflatable dwey arm. Oh, maybe I should sell merch where instead of like a Daki Makura, it's like a huge arm. Yeah, I feel like that would make sense if VTuber was like a giant test or something. Yeah, wrap your arms around me. It has to be two arms that you can wrap around. Weighted arms, muscular. Yeah. Yeah. Someone was in there stealing that idea. Well, it's fine. Neither of us are for that. >> I have some muscles. >> Yeah, >> I could definitely pick you up. >> Probably. >> Maybe.

We went horsing. >> I'm having a memory of someone sitting on my back, but no, it wasn't you. >> Oh, you played Uma? >> No, I couldn't get past the tutorial. I closed it halfway through. It is confusing, but after I finished like the first career that I it absorbed into my brain and I would play it again cuz it it I don't know there's something addictive about it, you know? They they've like perfected the gotcha like the little then the little sound like  you react to the sound. Isn't that what is that? That's like a thing. You react positively to this sound. Good human. Yes. Buy another horse. Yes, human. Buy another horse. Yeah, it's kind of crazy how they've perfected stuff like that. Like the addictive scrolling on Twitter. >> NASCAR did it first. >> What do you mean? They perfected the Well, actually, no, horse racing came before NASCAR. Let me let me let me backtrack. Let me take that back. Let me Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. But yeah, scrolling is addicting. Yeah. I don't think NASCAR is that popular anymore cuz now they have the racing with the with F1. >> Oh yeah. F1. My game's done. Okay. Should I start a lobby? >> Yeah. This >> is there character customization in this or is it like random? I think in the main menu there's customization, but you don't really have that much you can do to customize it with. You got to unlock it. >> Oh, I see. I microwave dog food and I could still smell it. Ooh, yummy. Mildly warm.  Yeah, I know. I can get past the tutorial of the mamm. Maybe I need to be in a different mindset. Maybe. Probably. Maybe you should get horse ears and then you'll be in the right mindset. >> Yeah, that's what we talked about last time. I want to be the horse. I don't want to have to. >> I was selfinserting. >> I guess you Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Who are you selfinserting as? Which one? I don't know the horses. >> My oshi horse.
