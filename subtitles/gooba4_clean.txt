Yes, of course. Give me one second. I can't figure out what the push to mute button is. >> Hello everybody on my side. But we're setting up. Oh, you're setting up on my side. Sorry. Hi. hahaha >> Once everybody's in, I'm going to mute on Discord cuz I I hear everybody twice. >> Wait, do we mute or you put everybody at 1? So, the Fuggie still jump. >> Uh, yeah. Yeah, I I'll zero. >> Ah, okay. And then we forget. >> You're already in here, so I'm gonna I'm gonna 0 you. Goodbye. >> Okay. Goodbye. hahaha >> Yippee. Ominously, I did not hear Dubbie twice. So, this is where the microphone issues start. >> Uh oh. Uh oh. >> Already your smug face. hahaha >> Where Where's the key binds? Like, it says you can do push to mute, but then doesn't tell you what the push to mute key is. >> Secret. >> Uh >> secret. Just press buttons. You'll eventually find out. I see. I have to boost you like 100 200. >> 200. God damn. Not V. I'm just going to start pressing random buttons until something works. That doesn't work. Try the push to talk button. I don't know what the pushto talk button is either. Oh, wait. There's a rebind control separately. Yippee. Let's find push to talk. There's that one. Oh, hahaha >> okay. So, it should be push to talk is V. >> V. >> Can you still hear me now? >> Yeah. >> Okay, that doesn't work. Good. Maybe I'll just leave it on push to talk because I can't find out what push to mute is. That's fine. I might I mean I might be dumb. There doesn't seem to be a push to mute. Well, let me bring the game up so you people can see at least. >> Wow, look at all the new stuff. They have chess now. Or checkers or which one is this? This is checkers. This is hahaha This is checkers. This is strategy game. What else do we have? We have basketball. Man, these things are so cool at the airport. >> B does not appear to be pushed to mute. If it is, it's not telling me that I'm so that makes it useless. >> It's back gammon. No, can I get a >> Hi, can you hear me now? >> I can hear you. >> Okay, cool. I'm going to keep it on push to talk. It seems as though there's not actually any indication like if you use push to mute, there's no indication on whether or not you're muted. So, you just kind of have to guess whether whether your mic is open or not, which sounds bad. So, I'm going to do push to talk. >> Excellent. Huh? >> Oh. Oh. Oh, can you send Dubie another invite? >> Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. One sec. We're using telekinesis coming right up. Man, one time I was at the airport and I was walking on one of these things and I think I just gotten off a like a really long haul flight and I took my hair down and I flipped it around and I felt like in that moment I was like, 'Wow, I feel like a wow, I feel like you're on the catwalk super long like tossing back and forth.' Yeah, >> I had a moment. I had a moment and then I came to reality and then I probably realized what I actually looked like and it was probably uh something out of like the grudge or something. No, but in your mind's eye, everything slowed down and your hair just like glinted in the overhead lights as it swept back and forth. hahaha Beautiful. Beautiful. >> Oh god. Oh, embarrassing. >> Who is I can hear you. [screaming] >> Yeah. Excellent. Excellent. >> Excellent. Valent. >> All right. >> All right. >> Thanks, guys. For waiting. >> Of course.

Oh, they have so many hats now. Oh, what the Oh, >> they added more hats. That's important. >> There's so many. There surely wasn't this many. >> Wait, I'm going to test the push to mute. You got to let me know. Hold on one sec. Let me Let me test it one moment. >> Okay. >> Wow, look at all your badges. >> Okay, you can hear me right now. >> Yeah. >> Yes. >> You didn't hear me the second time I asked? >> No. >> No. Okay, it works then. Yippee. >> It just doesn't tell you if you are muted. So that's one. >> I do kind of look like a chipmunk. >> I look very adorable. Thank you. A green a green adorable chipmunk. >> Adorable green chipmunk. >> Yes. >> But yeah, if the person breaks and you start hearing me talk to my chat, please just tell me to shut the damn up rather than just dealing with it.

Dang it. Shoot. Is this Why is this so difficult? I got a hat. That's it. >> Okay. So, unfortunately, when I turned into a ghost to try and help, my body became a zombie and murdered you. That's That's unfortunate. >> Eat my bones. >> There was in that little cave that you were in, if you like headed shimmy out to the side and then went up over it, there was a lip there, I think. Ah, >> but it was really hard to see in the fog cuz the that was really bad timing. That that damn wind coming in was so >> That wind sucks, man. >> Yeah, >> you guys did so good. Those zombies are ridiculous. Like the one that got me, he he literally like one two tapped me and I I got up and he immediately bit me again. I was like, 'Okay.' >> Yeah, he saba. Do not let them gaslight you. You You did feed me the medicinal route. I just had too much. I I had too much. I needed one more and I would have gotten up. >> I knew it. >> I knew it. >> You You did not betray me. You did. You did good. >> I knew it. hahaha >> Okay. One more for the road. Do you guys have time? >> One more for the road. >> Okay. This time we make it further and further every time. Surely this one will not end in disaster. >> This game is making me mad, man. It's not that hard of a game. Why? Like those are honestly a really hard biome. >> Yeah, what the heck? You know what? I feel bad. I was I was dogging on the ice biome and I was like, 'Good. It should stay gone.' You know what? Come on back. I don't mind it. It's not that bad. Ice biome is fine. >> I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was mean to you, jungle biome. I actually really like your unclimbable overhang. >> I really like your overhang. I really like your bushery. It's fine. Come on back now, please. Your shrubs are so nice. I don't mind the rain. The rain is fine. I like it. I've been in this place several times. Wait. hahaha >> All right. Wait. Is there nothing? There is stuff. >> I I already yanked a rope and and an energy drink. >> Oh. >> Um balloon. Do you want to shove that in my should put that in my bag? Maybe. >> I think it lightens me up. >> Hey, Bingong. How you doing? >> Thank you. Nice. >> Bing Bong. >> What did you do to him? >> Bing Bong's mad because you threatened. Wait, why is >> he [snorts] looks like an unlockable character. What' you do? >> I I I think I think you cooked him to a crisp. >> I think you killed him. >> I think you killed him. >> Oops. Sorry, Bing Bong. >> Oops. I thought he just wasn't speaking to you because last round you were like, I could leave Bing Bong behind. I was like, let's damn that. >> Let me cook a couple of these. >> Yeah, I don't know if it's worth it. I'll find out. >> Came in handy last round for me. I threw him at a explosive plant. >> You can throw them at a zombie. It's perfect. >> Oh, true. Uh, well, that went into the ocean. You think these are landing? >> Uh, no. It went into the ocean. >> Oh, I think I think I think I think we just go hahaha >> Don't eat that one without cooking it. It'll poison you. >> Holy coconuts. >> Here's the red ones. The >> red ones are good. Oh. You want this in your Oh, wait. There's a coconut here, too. I can take that. >> Uh, yeah. Put the red one in my bag. That's lighter. Oh, okay. Thank you. >> Yeah. >> Oh, do you want this one or should I have it? Can you eat the coconut? >> It's fine. I got the coconut. >> Okay. >> The coconut. >> All right. This time, for real, this time for sure. I don't remember which way we went because it dissolved into chaos. I was trying to the entire time you were below me, I was trying to get an angle on you so I could like uh rescue claw you up and then as  as you were just like when your foot went through the thing, you were just out of reach and then the wind blew you off. >> Dude, I >> It was merciless on you. Every time you made progress, I heard the wind start up. >> That was terrible. hahaha >> Or the spider. I think I got wrapped up by a spider like three times in a row cuz he kept dropping me back down in his in his range and he kept picking me back up again. >> So, what you're saying is you had an adventure. >> Um, you know what? You could call it that. >> If you really wanted that. >> Sounds like you were having fun down there. >> I wouldn't call it fun. I think I think my favorite part is when we got further away and I just kind of heard you went I'm using the book from hahaha so far down. >> Well, cuz I thought the book killed you. But it just turns you to bone and you don't get affected by any like statuses or anything. So if we actually It's actually really good for the mushroom. >> Bing bong. You're back. >> Bing bong. Bing bong. Is this the run? >> Bing bong. >> I'm going eat thisum. >> Yeah. No poison. No >> hunger. Little brain damage. >> Just wait. You take double fall damage. I think you're fine. Come on, Dub. What's in the suitcase? Oh, belong. Oh, the the the sport drink is good. >> Thailand for the road, boys. >> The cow. >> So many energy drinks for us. >> The cowfish. What? >> The cowfish. Oh. Isn't this what this is supposed to be? Eliz, you got to get your vitamins up because up until recently, you were a skeleton. >> Oh, thanks. >> You're welcome. >> It's like that stuff that people give their children so that they hit the growth percentile marks. What is it? PD. >> Isn't that what people do? >> Isn't that what it is? I can't think of any other use for like fortified milk other than when you if you're young and you're small, you have to drink Pedialyte to get taller. Pedia Pyshore Pedia something. >> My My mother just let me be small. >> Yeah. >> Like my parents are both taller than me and she was like, 'Guess you're just small, Lau.' And and let me stay that way. >> You're just small doesn't even do you. >> Hello. Why is there so much fun? Right. What? Oh, there is getting rid of my coconut. Green one here, but you'll have to cook it if you want it. I guess there's probably like a point where eating poison food actually ends up being better because the poison does wear off. >> Yeah. >> You just like, you know, once once you've had >> immunity Yeah. Once you've had like been violently sick down the mountain, it wears off and it's like, well, I'm not hungry anymore. >> A lesser of two evil. >> This looks real familiar. No, we've never been here before cuz we would never have to try again on this game. >> Are we on try number three? >> Try number one. >> It's always first try, >> right? >> Uhoh. What? >> I don't need I Okay. >> Yeah, you definitely didn't fall down, so it's all good. >> I'm gaming. >> Are we there yet? hahaha >> The fun part is is like when you realize even if we get through the jungle biome, there's like three of them. Three more. hahaha So, no point. >> They're not the other ones aren't as hard as this route one though, I don't think. Wait. Wait. Oh god, >> I lost track of where we went. I think it just this way. This way. I don't I don't know where Doobie just went. >> Doobie. >> Yeah. >> You are you arriving? >> Doobie. >> I'm cool. >> Okay. Okay. This magic bean is kind of useless. Oh, I was going to take it, but I I can't carry it. A prison pocket. No, I don't got one of those. I dropped it. Maybe it'll go. >> It did. Wow. >> To the moon. Literally. Okay. Bye. >> Oh, dude. That went far. >> It did. I have like an inherent mistr mistrust of bridges in this way in this game because I swear half the time my foot ends up through them. >> That's what happened to me on the on the tree. Uh >> yeah. >> Yeah, I saw >> I like how your foot ended up stuck in the bridge, but that wasn't enough to save you from the wind blowing you off. It's like, oh, you're stuck until you're not. Haha. >> What is the logic in that of That's what I said. I thought, 'Oh, I'm stuck. Oh, no. Oh, wait. I'm stuck. This is great.' No. >> Yes, I know you're screwed both ways. You thought that it was like a give and take. No, you're you're just damn hahaha >> It's okay. >> I humbly request your hands >> to help me out. >> Thank you. >> Yeah. Can I get one too, please? >> SHE TURNED AROUND AND LAUGHED MAD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT SAID. >> I SAW YOU. You were holding up your hand. I was like, >> I'm I'm pathf finding. >> I'm pathf finding is uh searching for the route. hahaha Wait, what was that map quest? You're my map quest. Do the zombies have like stamina? Can they make implausible climbs to get to you or do they do they have to do like do they follow scouts rules or >> I saw them climbing up behind you and then he was climbing up pretty far. >> Okay. What a jerk. >> They spawn in the worst places, too. Like why would they? I mean, why would they >> I loved when the wind went at the very end and three of them fell off the mountain in front of you. It's like, how many were in there? >> It was endless. It was like infinite. >> Infinite zombie drop. Totally fair, by the way. Totally fair. Why do I look so dumb? Boing. >> Yippee. I look like the yippy cat. Yippee. Yippee. >> You do. We're getting very good at doing this first part. >> That's true. Gummy bear. I'm tired of climbing the shore. >> I don't want to climb it anymore. Oh man. Ah. What present will you give us today, Scout Statue? Met something good. >> The book of bones. Wait, that's fantastic. Oh, amazing. >> Let's cook the book of bones. >> Wait, we should all go in. We should wait. How many people can Wait, wait, wait, wait. How many people? One person can use it. >> Cuz then somebody should Well, okay. Maybe we should save it.  Never mind. I don't know. >> One. It's one use. >> Did you use it like or is it just Does it kick in or something? I used it. You had a It was a It was the last ever. >> I did. >> How come there's only two marshmallows here? >> Uh, dips. We could use it to revive people. Maybe we should save it. I used to revive people. >> Oh, yeah. >> Oh, okay. Yeah, we can do that. >> Wait. Uh, start to die. I'm starting to die. Okay. >> Sorry. I I thought I thought we were doing that. Okay. The book is no now cooked. I don't know if that help helps, but it is. >> So, what are we doing with it? Is someone going to take it preemptively or is it an emergency measure? >> I think we should save it as a emergency measure. >> Okay. Uh Saba, I'm going to put it in this backpack and maybe one of you take it. Like I don't know who. >> Okay. I You use the book. You can take it. >> Okay, I will take it. >> I will take it. >> I think you suited being a skeleton. So, >> yeah, >> you do. You guys think you like you like >> pile of fishbones. >> Yeah. >> Oh, let me put this in your backpack. Hold on. >> Okay, >> there you go. >> Taking one for the team. >> No worries. say the tree tops like the >> we said we would if you if you use the same vine you can then climb onto the tree tops from it. >> It's going to absolutely suck in the wind though. >> True. I don't know if I like actually. Yeah, we're just going to blow off the thing at the like immediately. >> I don't even know where we go. I guess you just jump from branch. >> I mean the route the route that we took was really good. It's just like damn Should we try going like like that way? Like kind of in the middle but more towards the right. >> Yeah. Lead the way. I follow. Yeah. >> Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. Oh. Oh, she's going up. Oh, >> I was just going to jump on this. Looks fun. >> Oh jeez. Okay. I can do it, too. I can do it, too. I can do it, too. >> Okay. Jesus. >> You good? >> This world is too cruel. hahaha >> It's okay. If if if anything else, you got the book of bones. You're going to be great. >> Crud. I thought you guys were staying up there. What happened? >> Nah, we're uh we'll get blown off, I think. You know what? It'll be fine. >> I believe >> we don't have any other option. This biome is making me mad. I'm getting actually angry now. I'm angry now. I'm actually >> You sound furious. >> I'm furious. >> Oh, there's a medicinal root here. Let's take it. >> Oh, there's a ton over here. There's a ton of here. >> Does someone have any space?

Fine. Whatever. >> You don't want me to leave you. >> I uh I missed I missed the final grab on the route. I'm very sad. I broke my ankles. Fractured. >> We have medicinal medicinal roots. >> True. But we should probably keep them for the zombies. It's only a little bit. Is there any room in my backpack? >> No. But should I drop the energy drink? I feel like the root might be better now. >> Uh, the energy drink would be good for the end, but that doesn't matter if we die here, so maybe. >> God, I'm so This is the equivalent of having like an essay due the night before. You're just looking at it going, 'Oh, damn no. >> God, >> I could roast, but we might need that, too.' So, >> might need one of the apples. >> Oh, okay. Cool. The the energy drink is over there now if if you need it. >> I lose my mind. Losing it. >> Do you have room for that energy drink? If not, >> purple shroom. >> I can't remember. Is the cross good or bad? >> I'm going to eat it  at this point. I'm going to be the shroom doctor. >> Oh, I got >> Have we tried going the far left like all the way? Uh, we kind of did last round. I think we're pretty far over >> the This is the way that we went and we immediately ran into the cloud. I don't know if that's a good idea. Where's Where's Doobie? >> Okay. >> I I thought we followed Doobie. Let's have faith. >> Wait, a chain launcher is actually pretty good. >> Yeah, be careful. >> Oh, sorry. I looked away. Oh jeez. No. I'm sorry. I looked away. Ah. Oh, I think the cloud's going to get blown away by the wind. So that's >> cried. I know. She said be careful that I walked right into it. >> Oh no, Cloud's still there. >> Chain launcher's there, though. That's really good. I have a chain launcher and I have a What is this? A rope cannon. I feel like the rope cannon is more expendable. So, I'm going to put this in my bag and I'm going to hold on to the rope. Yes. >> This is rough because of the mist. We probably want to circle it around maybe. Oh god, it is. It is. It is like  growing. This is where This is where Saba and I died the first time. >> Okay. Wait. It's fine. >> Yeah. Is there Is there a safe spot over there? >> Uh, yeah.

Hello. hahaha >> Hi. >> Okay, >> fine. Because now we've kept all of our resources. It'll be fine. And we're going to win. Careful. Watch this. Watch this. Watch this. Oh damn >> Oh god.

I don't know how to place it. >> There are so many exploding things over here. >> What if we just >> Which way should we go? We could go up. We need >> that. Looks like >> this this way. I think like we need to get up here. >> We need We need to get some kind of verticality because the fog is almost here. >> Everything. >> I have the cannon. Should we bother with it? I'll just put it away for now. >> Maybe this was the right way the whole time. >> Who would have thought? >> Let's speedun. No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, this is the way you and I went before. Before we, you know, got stuck and >> before we died. Yeah, >> I wasn't I wasn't going I wasn't going to say that. I wasn't going to say that. It's this way. There's a little al cove. You can hide in here. >> Little al cove. Little corner or a little hidey corner. A little little tiny. >> Okay, here we go. Here we get the Yep. >> Now, the cannon is kind of heavy. Does anybody else want the cannon or should we just >> I will not use the cannon. You can use it to get up there. Look, we can shoot over there. That way. >> Uh, actually, we should reverse direction this way. No, actually, cuz there's a fog. But I don't think we can get that much height.

Let's see if we can go internally because we have we have mildly damn up, but that's okay. >> Just a little bit. It's reversible. >> Yeah, we're going to we're going to find Doobie. We're going to reunite. It's going to be beautiful. >> It's going to be beautiful. We're going to cry. There was like a red thing down there. Did What is that? >> I don't know what that was. >> It's It's almost good. This is almost good. >> Almost. Not quite. Huh? >> Uh, >> do you have like a anything? >> A what? >> You have a uh anything? >> Anything? We might be able to make this. >> You got like a candy. >> You probably want to save that though. Yeah, >> I can make that. >> You can make that. >> You want something? Abs. Yeah, I can make that. >> Okay. Show Show me your gamer skills. >> Do you want the lollipop for safety?

All right, we're going to reunite and everything's going to be great. >> Uh, let's try this way first. >> Hello. >> Hi. >> Hi. >> A prickle. hahaha >> Yeah. >> Um. >> Oh, this up here. seems to save. >> I feel like I'm stuck in a suburban American neighborhood. This feels terrible. >> One thing I always found amazing about America is like how big their garages are. >> Like every I went into this suburb and it was just like houses that were pretty big and then they all have these like absolutely gigantic garages. >> You could have a threecar garage and then you can have a separate entryway for your golf cart depending on where you live. There we go. >> Yeah. In Florida, people drive their golf cart to the grocery store. I wish I was joking. hahaha >> That's amazing. >> Come on in, y'all. >> Hop in the golf cart. We got to go on over to Pub. >> This way. This way. >> Need me a refill of my beans. >> Going to drive my golf cart to to to the grocery store where I can pick up a gun. Oh no, she was so young. That's okay though. Now we can be like, 'Wow, I can't believe that she didn't make any progress.' Uh, there are two routes we could maybe take. Let's try this one. >> Okay, >> come back. hahaha >> I'll try and reinvite. If you get hit and killed by a golf car, is it vehicular manslaughter? It's a vehicle, right? It does it count as a vehicle, though, if you can't drive it on the road. H >> Oh, I can see where she's been because all the suitcases are looted. >> There's a pile of stuff. Die should be able to rejoin. >> I like I like I like how if you don't make if you don't jump first, you take more damage from falling. I swear. >> Huh? >> Yeah. I don't know. I should have been I shouldn't have taken damage from that. Yay. She's back. >> If it has an engine and four wheels and it counts as vehicular manslaughter. Okay, I raise you this question then. >> Wait, it doesn't have a Wait, engine or battery? Could it technically have a battery? Does a golf cart have an engine? Does anybody know? >> I'm pretty sure a golf cart does not have an engine. I think it has a battery. >> Which way should we be going? We found your your opened uh opened suitcase. >> Motorcycle. I should have >> Oh, uh my open suitcase. I don't know where. >> What about the Barbie Jeep? >> If you get in one of those Have you been Have you been stun locked by your own golf cart? Question. >> I don't have a golf cart. But I'm just saying like does it if you know those like those like do you know those like kitty carts you can get and they like various cartoon characters on them. Does that count if somebody gets hit and killed with that? Is that still vehicular? >> I think it would be very impressive if you got hit and killed by that. Make the jump. Make the jump. >> There's lots of places you can stop here. >> There you go. >> Wait, do we connect it in? Do we where did we drop? >> She's here. >> You can mostly just walk that. That works too. We are We went around like the inside instead. Is she at the flag? Maybe I put it down. I don't know if I did anything. >> Oh, yeah. Did you spawn at the flag, Duby? >> I don't think so. I'm back by my open suitcase. >> Oh, yeah. No, it sounds like you you maybe went where we put the flag. >> If it was a mod car with a big motor, then surely >> What's that noise? Do you hear that? That big there's like a there's a big booming noise. >> I don't hear a big booming noise. >> Oh, hey guys. >> What? >> I think it was your head bouncing off the canyon walls. hahaha >> My big brain. Wait, I'm not going to make this. >> Uh, you can jump around here and I can catch you. There's like a little spot here. >> Oh, like >> wait. Wait. Live. Does she look the same? Does What does she look like to you right now? >> Normal. >> Okay. She does not look normal for me. >> What's wrong with me? >> You are. >> There's nothing wrong with you. Don't listen to her. >> Yeah, you >> You're so right. >> That's definitely what the banging is. My head does kind of hurt. So, >> wait. Don't touch me. >> Slamming her head into walls. Is that what you're saying? >> Uh, I don't know how to explain it, guys. I don't know. >> You knew it in a very weird way, but hopefully you're okay. >> I'm fine. Don't worry about it. >> It feels funny. >> I don't know how to explain that. hahaha >> Does that explain it? >> Why? >> Don't touch me. Oh god, don't touch me. >> She looks completely normal to me, man. >> You have to see. This is what >> Wait, is she Is she Is she Is she Is she golden eyeing?

Oh, >> so she's get dawning. >> Okay, I I understand what you're seeing now. Thank you for the explanation. hahaha >> Chris, I keep HEARING BANG BANG BANG. And I think it's her body or her head hitting the walls. >> Oh, you still hear it now? >> I don't hear anything. I You've been fine the whole time for me. It's just >> like a big basketball. hahaha Gmod collisions. >> Even your clothing is making noise. >> I'm not doing anything. >> You sound like a fly. >> It sucks, man. >> My tummy hurts. >> Don't get too close. hahaha >> Are you gatekeeping? You trying to physic? hahaha >> No. >> My face hurts. Just waiting for this one to pass. >> There is there is like an indoor path. It depends on safe. >> Oh yeah.
