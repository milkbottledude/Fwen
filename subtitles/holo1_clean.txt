<c.colorF6A02D> How was your summer this year, Haato? 
<c.colorE8003F> I had a really fulfilling summer! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Did you go out to a few places? 
<c.colorE8003F> I ate shaved ice, ice cream... 
<c.colorE8003F> Did you have some ice? 
<c.colorF6A02D> I did have some ice cream! 
<c.colorE8003F> Nice! Ice cream is delicious, right? 
<c.colorF6A02D> I'm actually eating ice cream every day. 
<c.colorE8003F> Oh, that's nice. 
<c.colorE8003F> Chocomint? 
<c.colorF6A02D> I've never had chocomint. 
<c.colorE8003F> I'm so sleepy! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Coming to school during 
<c.colorE8003F> Studying during summer break? Blegh! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Are you good at studying? 
<c.colorF6A02D> Wait, if you could, 
<c.colorF6A02D> You can't, so that's why you're stuck here! 
<c.colorE8003F> I can! I totally can! 
<c.colorE8003F> I am... I am here on purpose! 
<c.colorF6A02D> On purpose?! Why? 
<c.colorF6A02D> What purpose would that have? 
<c.colorE8003F> Huh, what's up? 
<c.colorF6A02D> Wait, is that- 
<c.colorF6A02D> One of us! 
<c.colorF6A02D> You're one of us! 
<c.colorE8003F> I was studying for the make-up 
<c.colorE8003F> Why don't you study together with us? 
<c.colorF6A02D> Alright then, sit down over here! 
<c.colorE8003F> Come here! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Bring over the table! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Ta-da! Question! 
<c.colorF6A02D> What does "H" stand for? 
<c.colorE8003F> "H"?! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Like, what element? 
<c.colorE8003F> Hydrogen! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Are you a genius?! 
<c.colorE8003F> I am! 
<c.colorF6A02D> You really are! 
<c.colorE8003F> Alright then... When was the 
<c.colorF6A02D> The saying goes, One-one-nine-two, 
<c.colorF6A02D> so it's in 1192! 
<c.colorE8003F> Wow! That's perfect! 
<c.colorE8003F> Wait, do we even need to study? 
<c.colorE8003F> Aren't we good? 
<c.colorF6A02D> We're good, right? 
<c.colorF6A02D> Speaking of which, I recently started 
<c.colorE8003F> Wait, really? So it's 
<c.colorF6A02D> Yeah, it's getting popular again! 
<c.colorE8003F> Nice... I want some too, now. 
<c.colorF6A02D> I really like the oolong milk tea flavor. 
<c.colorE8003F> Sounds nice! 
<c.colorF6A02D> It's super good! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Alright, here's one for you. 
<c.colorF6A02D> Question: 
<c.colorF6A02D> Who does Haato-chan like? 
<c.colorE8003F> Why would you ask that?! 
<c.colorF6A02D> I was just wondering if they knew, is all... 
<c.colorE8003F> I don't like anybody! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Hmm, that's not what I heard, though. 
<c.colorE8003F> What about you, 
<c.colorF6A02D> Erm... I... uhm... 
<c.colorE8003F> Why are you hiding it? 
<c.colorF6A02D> And what about you? 
<c.colorE8003F> Are you deaf? I already said 
<c.colorF6A02D> I'll tell you later. 
<c.colorFEFEFE> I just realized something! 
<c.colorFEFEFE> Didn't we just chat all day and 
<c.colorE8003F> Huh? 
<c.colorF6A02D> I was having a hard time 
<c.colorE8003F> I tried to focus, I swear! 
<c.colorF6A02D> This is too hard for me... 
<c.colorFEFEFE> And it's almost time 
<c.colorFEFEFE> We ought to give up on the make-up test 
<c.colorF6A02D> Wait, are we already doomed 
<c.colorE8003F> No way! 
<c.colorFEFEFE> Let's take the make-up test and 
<c.colorF6A02D> Really? 
<c.colorE8003F> Can we? 
<c.colorFEFEFE> We're in this together. 
<c.colorE8003F> Thank you so much! 
<c.colorE8003F> You're really nice, aren't you! 
<c.colorF6A02D> I've got a new perspective 
<c.colorFEFEFE> Don't worry about it. 
<c.colorE8003F> Is there a good place? 
<c.colorE8003F> Restaurants are too noisy to focus on... 
<c.colorF6A02D> My place isn't going to work either... 
<c.colorE8003F> I don't think my place 
<c.colorF6A02D> Oh! 
<c.colorE8003F> Did you think of something? 
<c.colorF6A02D> How about your house? 
<c.colorE8003F> Wow, that's a great idea! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Great, isn't it? 
<c.colorFEFEFE> What? My place...?! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Come on, please! 
<c.colorF6A02D> I really wanna come over to your house... 
<c.colorF6A02D> In exchange, 
<c.colorFEFEFE> Yeah... 
<c.colorE8003F> I also really want to go! 
<c.colorE8003F> Come on! Come on! Come on! 
<c.colorE8003F> You wouldn't say no, right? 
<c.colorE8003F> Please! 
<c.colorE8003F> I'll obey any request of yours, too, 
<c.colorE8003F> So, please! 
<c.colorFEFEFE> ...Alright then, I guess I have no choice. 
<c.colorE8003F> Yay, thanks! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Thank you! 
<c.colorF6A02D> You're the best! 
<c.colorE8003F> I knew you'd not let us down! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Let's go grab some snacks, then! 
<c.colorE8003F> Oh, that's a good idea! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Yeah, what do you want? 
<c.colorE8003F> Cr*cker J*ck? 
<c.colorF6A02D> That's so retro! 
<c.colorE8003F> Let's go! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Oh wait, the test. We gotta 
<c.colorF6A02D> First things first. 
<c.colorE8003F> You're all we have! 
<c.colorFEFEFE> Heart Skip Summer! 
<c.colorF6A02D> That was the first movie, 
<c.colorF6A02D> I guess that did make your 
<c.colorF6A02D> Haato-chan, how did 
<c.colorE8003F> That was just me being me. 
<c.colorE8003F> The mood was also so light, 
<c.colorE8003F> I ended up laughing a lot. 
<c.colorE8003F> it was more of a comedy. 
<c.colorE8003F> It was really fun. 
<c.colorF6A02D> It was really fun, right? 
<c.colorE8003F> How was it for you? 
<c.colorF6A02D> Yeah, it's really a little thing 
<c.colorE8003F> Oh, right! 
<c.colorF6A02D> that gives you the most 
<c.colorF6A02D> I also think it was really really good. 
<c.colorE8003F> Right, that was really nice. 
<c.colorF6A02D> Your heart-eyes were also really cute. 
<c.colorE8003F> Your expression was also really cute. 
<c.colorE8003F> This feeling of being slightly teased 
<c.colorE8003F> is something that might 
<c.colorF6A02D> It was great, right? 
<c.colorF6A02D> With that being said, next up, 
<c.colorF6A02D> let's move on to the second movie! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Yeah, for me, this one is the one. 
<c.colorE8003F> This one's the real hitter? 
<c.colorF6A02D> This one will make hearts stop! 
<c.colorE8003F> What's it called? 
<c.colorF6A02D> Without further ado! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Here's "The Two Treasures"! 
<c.colorE8003F> What?! "The Two Treasures"?! 
<c.colorF6A02D> I'm sure you're dying to know 
<c.colorE8003F> I sure am! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Let's jump right into it, then! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Produced by Natsuiro Matsuri: 
<c.colorFEFEFE> Produced by Natsuiro Matsuri: 
<c.color5EDDEE> Start! 
<c.colorF6A02D> I'm so hungry! 
<c.colorE8003F> I love festivals! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Oh, look, there's a takoyaki stall. 
<c.colorE8003F> Wow, that smells really good! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Should we get some later? 
<c.colorE8003F> What should we start with? 
<c.colorF6A02D> Huh? 
<c.colorE8003F> Huh? 
<c.colorE8003F> You also came to the festival? 
<c.colorF6A02D> Huh? Don't tell me... 
<c.colorF6A02D> You came by yourself? 
<c.colorF6A02D> That's so sad! 
<c.colorE8003F> What a loner! 
<c.colorFEFEFE> Sh-Shut it! 
<c.colorE8003F> It'd be a pity to leave you like that, 
<c.colorF6A02D> You'll have a lady in each arm! 
<c.colorE8003F> Good idea, right? 
<c.colorFEFEFE> Thanks, I guess? 
<c.colorF6A02D> Oh, I want to eat a candy apple! 
<c.colorE8003F> Good idea! 
<c.colorE8003F> I might go for some yakisoba. 
<c.colorF6A02D> What about you? 
<c.colorFEFEFE> Nothing in particular. 
<c.colorF6A02D> Hmm, let's share, then! 
<c.colorF6A02D> I'll go first. You guys wait here. 
<c.colorE8003F> Okay! 
<c.colorE8003F> Take care! 
<c.colorF6A02D> I'll be right back! 
<c.colorE8003F> Looks like it's just the two of us now... 
<c.colorFEFEFE> Yeah... 
<c.colorE8003F> Hey... Anything you'd like 
<c.colorE8003F> Thinking that maybe I'd run on you 
<c.colorFEFEFE> Wha...?! It's... You look really cute! 
<c.colorE8003F> Thank you! 
<c.colorE8003F> You know, there are 
<c.colorE8003F> How about we steal away 
<c.colorE8003F> I'd really like to watch them with you. 
<c.colorFEFEFE> Huh?! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Sorry for the wait! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Haato-chan, you can go get your food! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Oh, yeah, sure! 
<c.colorF6A02D> I'll be on my way! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Yeah, take care! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Hey, what were you talking 
<c.colorFEFEFE> We, uh... were just reminiscing about 
<c.colorF6A02D> Hm. Really...? Sounds fishy... 
<c.colorF6A02D> Well, whatever. 
<c.colorF6A02D> By the way, are you going to stay 
<c.colorFEFEFE> Hmm, I don't really know... 
<c.colorF6A02D> Well then, how about the two of us 
<c.colorFEFEFE> What?! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Don't you want to have me 
<c.colorF6A02D> So... you'll come, right? 
<c.colorF6A02D> Please! 
<c.colorFEFEFE> Who will you choose? 
<c.colorFEFEFE> Heart Skip Summer 
<c.colorF6A02D> Heart Skip Summer! 
<c.colorF6A02D> That was "The Two Treasures"! 
<c.colorF6A02D> How did you like it? 
<c.colorE8003F> How was it? 
<c.colorE8003F> It really got your hearts racing, right? 
<c.colorF6A02D> it was a bit more of 
<c.colorE8003F> Your candy apple was really cute! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Thank you! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Haato-chan, how was it? 
<c.colorE8003F> I kind of wanted to get up really close 
<c.colorF6A02D> Oh, really? 
<c.colorE8003F> Or, at least I thought so, 
<c.colorE8003F> but I did feel a bit embarrassed there. 
<c.colorF6A02D> That only made it better! 
<c.colorE8003F> But it was really nice. Also, 
<c.colorE8003F> being at that festival 
<c.colorE8003F> The warmth of summer really was there. 
<c.colorF6A02D> You're right! 
<c.colorE8003F> A bunch of nostalgic and 
<c.colorF6A02D> Few things are as youthful as going 
<c.colorF6A02D> I wonder which of us they chose? 
<c.colorE8003F> Who was it?! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Who's your best girl? Who's your best girl? 
<c.colorE8003F> Could they be planning to say, 
<c.colorF6A02D> Choose both? 
<c.colorE8003F> You wouldn't cop out 
<c.colorE8003F> No way! 
<c.colorFEFEFE> First Half 
<c.colorFEFEFE> Second Half 
<c.colorF6A02D> And say, "Let's meet at the start 
<c.colorF6A02D> Only trash would do that! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Alright, that's it for this video! 
<c.colorF6A02D> This was the hololive official channel's 
<c.colorF6A02D> "Heart Skip Summer"! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Did we make the end 
<c.colorE8003F> Did you feel warmer inside than outside? 
<c.colorE8003F> For those who haven't yet seen 
<c.colorE8003F> there are some links in the description, 
<c.colorE8003F> But, for real, 
<c.colorE8003F> I could feel everyone's personality, 
<c.colorF6A02D> It was really nice. 
<c.colorE8003F> It was the best! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Alright then! 
<c.colorF6A02D> If your heart skipped a beat, 
<c.colorE8003F> Leave your thoughts below! 
<c.colorF6A02D> Alright! 
<c.colorF6A02D> It's time to say goodbye!
